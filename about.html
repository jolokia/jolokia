<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image jolokiaLogo right"><img src="images/jolokia_home.png" alt="Jolokia, homegrown"/></span> All started up early 2009 when my colleague Gerhard Lausser,
our local Nagios guru, came up in my office and complained
heavily about how damned hard it is to monitor Java EE servers
with <a href="https://www.nagios.org" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nagios</a>. As you might
know, Nagios uses a plethora of plugins for doing the hard
monitoring stuff. These are running locally on a central
Nagios host contacting the watched systems mostly remotely
with various techniques. For Java applications,
<a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javamanagement.html" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JMX</a>
is of course the proper choice which provides
<a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=160" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JSR-160</a>
connectors remote access to the local MBeans. At this time,
indeed several JMX Nagios plugins were already
present. However, they all suffer from the same problem:
JSR-160 connectors are highly Java centric where its default
protocol RMI is not available outside the Java universe. So,
each plugin (which runs in an external process when called by
Nagios) needs to start up a Java Virtual Machine. This has to
be done for every check, and since there are usual hundreds of
checks every five minutes this becomes easily a performance
and memory bottleneck. Additionally, you need a Java
installation on the Nagios host, which for many administrators
poses a, let&#8217;s say 'cultural' problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a Java programmer I love JMX. It is one of the oldest Java
specifications, which was carefully crafted from the very
beginning (especially the core API). Other Java APIs had to
take a longer tour until they became widely accepted by the
masses as not being painful (think "EJB" or "JSF"). However,
I&#8217;m not really happy with JSR-160&#8217;s focus on Java based remote
protocols. There has been some efforts to make these more
friendly to the outside world (e.g. a
<a href="https://ws-jmx-connector.dev.java.net/" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JSR-160 WebService connector</a> as defined in JSR-262), but it seems
there is not much momentum anymore behind these. In fact, the
last update on
<a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=262" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JSR-262</a> was in
May 2008 and it is marked as "inactive". And frankly, I don&#8217;t
want to use WebServices for monitoring, either (although
<a href="https://dmtf.org/standards/wsman" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WS-Management</a> is an
interesting approach).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That was the birth of <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/jmx4perl" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jmx4perl</a> in May
2009. Coming from a strong Perl background (being a SGI system
administrator at university in my former life), my initial goal
was to use pure Perl for accessing remote JMX information without
the need of a local Java integration.  In turned out that an agent
based approach was the simplest way. The first agent, a Java EE
webapplication, which on the frontside translates HTTP requests with
a JSON payload to local JMX calls (and vice versa for the response),
was really lightweight. It knew how to read and set attributes and
how to execute operations. It had a list mode for looking up all
registered MBeans. And it was
<a href="https://labs.consol.de/maven/repository/org/jmx4perl/j4p-agent/0.16/j4p-agent-0.16.war" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">38kb</a> in size.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The jmx4perl agent is now ~ 200kb 'large' with many more
features (search, bulk requests, security, &#8230;&#8203;.) but I still call it
lighweight ;-). The perl part consists now of a powerful
Nagios plugin called
<a href="https://search.cpan.org/~roland/jmx4perl/scripts/check_jmx4perl" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check_jmx4perl</a>,
a command line tool called
<a href="https://search.cpan.org/~roland/jmx4perl/scripts/jmx4perl" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jmx4perl</a>,
a Perl library named
<a href="https://search.cpan.org/~roland/jmx4perl/lib/JMX/Jmx4Perl.pm" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JMX::Jmx4Perl</a>
and a readline based (with context sensitive tab completion on
MBean names) JMX shell called
<a href="https://search.cpan.org/~roland/jmx4perl/scripts/j4psh" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">j4psh</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From the feedback I got, it seems that the Nagios world is happy
now. But since I think that this agent based approach provides also a
good alternative to JSR-160 connectors for other platforms, it is
time to move on and split the Java and Perl part of jmx4perl into two
separate projects. The number of programmers who love both Java
and Perl is negligible anyway ;-). The Perl part (which is
approximately the same size as the Java part) remains jmx4perl,
the agent part has become &#8230;&#8203; Jolokia.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jolokia is one of the world hottest chili pepper with a
Scoville rating of at most
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale#List_of_Scoville_ratings" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1,075,000</a>. I&#8217;m
a chili head and grow chilis since 2006. I love chilis as much
as JMX. That&#8217;s the main reason.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other reason is, that a chili is a good metaphore for a
hot, new approach for JMX remoting. Especially when it is the
hottest one ;-)</p>
