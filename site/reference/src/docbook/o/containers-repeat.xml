    <title>Repeat until true</title>

    <para>Quite similar to the previously described iterate container this repeating container will execute its actions in
    a loop according to an ending condition. The condition describes a Boolean expression using
    the operators as described in the previous chapter.</para>

    <important>
      <para>The loop continues its work until the provided condition evaluates to true. It is very important to notice that the
      repeat loop will execute the actions before evaluating the condition. This means the actions get executed
      1-n times.</para>
