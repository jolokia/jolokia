    <title>Including own actions</title>

    <para>The generic &lt;action&gt; element references Spring beans that implement the Java interface 
    <literal>com.consol.citrus.TestAction</literal>. This is a very fast way to add your own action 
    implementations to a test case. You can implement own actions in Java and include them into a test case.</para>
    
    <programlisting>
  &lt;testcase name=&quot;actionReferenceTest&quot;&gt;
      &lt;actions&gt;
          &lt;action reference=&quot;cleanUpDatabase&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;action reference=&quot;mySpecialAction&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/actions&gt;
  &lt;/testcase&gt;
    </programlisting>
    
    <para>In the example above the called actions are special database cleanup implementations. The actions are defined as Spring beans 
    in the Citrus configuration and get referenced by their bean name or id.</para>
