  <title>OSGi Agents</title>
    <sidebar>There are several free implementations available of OSGi
    HttpService. This bundle has been tested with the <ulink
    url="http://wiki.ops4j.org/display/paxweb/Pax+Web">Pax Web</ulink>
    and <ulink
    url="http://felix.apache.org/site/apache-felix-http-service.html">Apache
    Felix</ulink> HttpService, both of which come with an embedded Jetty
    as servlet container by default.</sidebar>
  <para>
    Jolokia agents are also available as <ulink
    url="http://www.osgi.org">OSGi</ulink> bundles. There are two
    flavors of this agent: A nearly bare agent
    <filename>jolokia-osgi.jar</filename> declaring all its package
    dependencies as imports in its Manifest and an all-in-one bundle
    <filename>jolokia-osgi-bundle.jar</filename> with minimal
    dependencies. The pure bundle fits best with the OSGi philosophy and is
    hence the recommended bundle. The all-in-one monster is good for a
    quick start since normally no additional bundles are required.
  </para>
  <section id="agents-osgi-pure">
    <title>jolokia-osgi.jar</title>
    <para>
      This bundle depends mostly on a running <ulink
      url="http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v42/org/osgi/service/http/HttpService.html">OSGi
      HttpService</ulink> which it uses for registering the agent
      servlet.
    </para>
    <para>
      All package imports of this bundle are listed in <xref
      linkend="table-agents-osgi-deps"/>. Note that the
      <classname>org.osgi.framework.*</classname> and
      <classname>javax.*</classname> packages are typically exported
      by the system bundle, so no extra installation effort is
      required here. Whether the
      <classname>org.osgi.service.*</classname> interfaces are
      available depends on your OSGi container. If they are not
      provided, they can be easily fetched and installed from e.g.
      <ulink
      url="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/osgi/org.osgi.compendium/4.2.0/org.osgi.compendium-4.2.0.jar">maven
      central</ulink>. Often the LogService interface is exported
      out of the box, but not the HttpService. You will notice any
      missing package dependency during the resolve phase while
      installing <filename>jolokia-osgi.jar</filename>.

      This agent bundle consumes two services by default: As stated
      above, an
      <classname>org.osgi.service.http.HttpService</classname> which
      is used to register (deregister) the Jolokia agent as a servlet
      under the context <literal>/jolokia</literal> by default as soon
      as the HttpService becomes available (unavailable). Secondly, an
      <classname>org.osgi.service.log.LogService</classname> is used
      for logging, if available. If such a service is not registered,
      the Jolokia bundle uses the standard
      <methodname>HttpServlet.log()</methodname> method for its
      logging needs.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Jolokia OSGi bundle can be configured via the OSGi Configuration Admin
      service using the PID <literal>org.jolokia.osgi</literal>
      (e.g. if using Apache Karaf, place properties in
      <literal>etc/org.jolokia.osgi.cfg</literal>), or alternatively via global
      properties which typically can be configured in a configuration file of
      the OSGi container. All properties start with the prefix
      <literal>org.jolokia</literal> and are listed in <xref
      linkend="table-agents-osgi-properties"/>. They are mostly the
      same as the <literal>init-param</literal> options for
      a Jolokia servlet when used in a Java EE WAR artifact.

      i.e. the <ulink
      url="http://felix.apache.org/site/apache-felix-http-service.html">Felix
      implementation</ulink>. The HttpService will be registered as
      OSGi service during startup, so it is available for other
      bundles as well. The only package import requirement for this
      bundle is <classname>org.osgi.service.LogService</classname>,
      since the Felix Webservice requires this during startup. As
      mentioned above, normally the LogService interface gets exported
      by default in the standard containers, but if not, you need to
      install it e.g. from the OSGi <ulink
      url="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/osgi/org.osgi.compendium/4.2.0/org.osgi.compendium-4.2.0.jar">compendium
      </ulink> definitions.

      This bundle can be configured the same way as the pure bundle as
      described in <xref linkend="agents-osgi-pure"/>. Additionally,
      the embedded Felix HttpService can be configured as described in
      its <ulink
      url="http://felix.apache.org/site/apache-felix-http-service.html#ApacheFelixHTTPService-ConfigurationProperties">documentation</ulink>.
      e.g. setting the port to 9090 instead of the default port 8080, a property
      <literal>org.osgi.service.http.port=9090</literal> needs to be
      set. This might be useful, if this bundle is used within
      containers which already occupy the default port (Glassfish,
      Eclipse Virgo) but don't expose an OSGi HttpService.

    <title>Programmatic servlet registration</title>
    <para>
      It is also possible to register the Jolokia agent servlet
      manually instead of relying of the OSGi bundle activator which
      comes with the agents. For this use case
      <filename>jolokia-osgi.jar</filename> should be used. This
      bundle exports the package
      <classname>org.jolokia.osgi.servlet</classname> which includes
      the servlet class <classname>JolokiaServlet</classname>. This
      class has three constructors: A default constructor without
      arguments, one with a single
      <classname>BundleContext</classname> argument and finally one
      with an additional <classname>Restrictor</classname> (see <xref
      linkend="security-restrictor"/> for details how access
      restrictions can be applied). The constructor with a
      <classname>BundleContext</classname> as its argument has the
      advantage that it will use an OSGi
      <classname>LogService</classname> if available and adds various
      OSGi server detectors which adds server information like product
      name and version to the <literal>version</literal>
      command. Refer to <xref linkend="version"/> for details about the
      server infos provided.
    </para>
    <para>
      Please note that for this use case the bundle
      <classname>org.jolokia.osgi</classname> should not be
      <emphasis>started</emphasis> but left in the state
      <emphasis>resolved</emphasis>. Otherwise, as soon as an OSGi
      HttpService registers, this bundle will try to add yet another
      agent servlet to this service, which is probably not what you
      want. Alternatively, the bundle property
      <literal>org.jolokia.listenForHttpService</literal> can be set
      to <literal>false</literal> in which case there will be never an
      automatic servlet registration to an HttpService.

    <title>Restrictor service</title>
    <para>
      As described in <xref linkend="security-restrictor"/>, the
      Jolokia agent can use custom restrictors implementing the
      interface
      <classname>org.jolokia.restrictor.Restrictor</classname>. If the
      bundle property
      <literal>org.jolokia.useRestrictorService</literal> is set to
      true and no restrictor is configured by other means, the agent
      will use one or more OSGi service which register under the name
      <classname>org.jolokia.restrictor.Restrictor</classname>. If no
      such service is available, access to the agent is always
      denied. If one such restrictor service is available, the access
      decision is delegated to this service. When more than one
      restrictor service is available, access is ony granted if all of
      them individually grant access. A sample restrictor service as a
      maven project can be found in the Jolokia source at
      <filename>agent/osgi/restrictor-sample</filename>.
