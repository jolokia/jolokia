  <title>OSGi Agents</title>
    <sidebar>Threre are several free implementations of an OSGi
    HttpService available. This bundle has been tested with the <ulink
    url="http://wiki.ops4j.org/display/paxweb/Pax+Web">Pax Web</ulink>
    and <ulink
    url="http://felix.apache.org/site/apache-felix-http-service.html">Apache
    Felix</ulink> HttpService which both come with an embedded Jetty
    as servlet container by default.</sidebar>
  <para>
    Jolokia agents are also available as <ulink
    url="http://www.osgi.org">OSGi</ulink> bundles. There are two
    flavors of this agent: A nearly bare agent
    <filename>jolokia-osgi.jar</filename> declaring all its package
    dependencies as imports in its Manifest and an all-in-one bundle
    <filename>jolokia-osgi-bundle.jar</filename> with minimal
    dependecies. The pure bundle fits best the OSGi philosophy and is
    hence the recommended bundle. The all-in-one monster is good for a
    quick start since normally no additional bundles are required.

      This bundle depends mostly on a running <ulink
      url="http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v42/org/osgi/service/http/HttpService.html">OSGi
      HttpService</ulink> which is uses for registering the agent
      servlet.

    <para>
      All package imports of this bundle are listed in <xref
      linkend="table-agents-osgi-deps"/>. Note that the
      <classname>org.osgi.framework.*</classname> and
      <classname>javax.*</classname> packages are typically exported
      by the sytem bundle, so no extra installation efforts are
      required here. Whether the
      <classname>org.osgi.service.*</classname> interfaces are
      available depends on your OSGi container. If they are not
      provided, they can be easily fetched and install from e.g.
      <ulink
      url="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/osgi/org.osgi.compendium/4.2.0/org.osgi.compendium-4.2.0.jar">maven
      central</ulink>. Often the LogService interface is exported also
      out of the box but not the HttpService. You will notice any
      missing package dependency during the resolve phase while
      installing <filename>jolokia-osgi.jar</filename>.

      This agent bundle consumes two services by default: As stated
      above an
      <classname>org.osgi.service.http.HttpService</classname> which
      is used to register (deregister) the Jolokia agent as a servlet
      under the context <literal>/jolokia</literal> by default as soon
      as the HttpService becomes available (unavailable). Second, an
      <classname>org.osgi.service.log.LogService</classname> is used
      for logging, if available. If such a service is not registered,
      the Jolokia bundle uses the standard
      <methodname>HttpServlet.log()</methodname> method for its
      logging needs.

    <para>
      The Jolokia OSGi bundle can be configured via properties which
      typically can be configured in a global configuration file of
      the OSGi container. All properties starts with a prefix
      <literal>org.jolokia</literal> and are listed in <xref
      linkend="table-agents-osgi-properties"/>. They are mostly the
      same as the possible <literal>init-param</literal> values for
      a Jolokia servlet when used in a JEE WAR artifact.

      This bundle also exports a service
      <classname>org.jolokia.osgi.servlet.JolokiaContext</classname>
      which can be used to obtain context information of the
      registered agent like the context path under which this
      servlet can be reached or the
      <classname>org.osgi.service.http.HttpContext</classname> which
      is used for authentication. Note that this service is only
      available when the agent servlet is active (i.e. when an
      HttpService is registered).

  <section id="agents-osgi-bundle">
    <title>jolokia-osgi-bundle.jar</title>
    <para>
      The all-in-one bundle includes an implementation of
      <classname>org.osgi.service.http.HttpService</classname>,
      i.e. the <ulink
      url="http://felix.apache.org/site/apache-felix-http-service.html">Felix
      implementation</ulink>. The HttpService will be registered as
      OSGi service during startup, so it is available for other
      bundles as well. The only package import requirement for this
      bundle is <classname>org.osgi.service.LogService</classname>,
      since the Felix Webservice requires this during startup. As
      mentioned above, normally the LogService interface gets exported
      by default in the standard containers, but if not, you need to
      install it e.g. from the OSGi <ulink
      url="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/osgi/org.osgi.compendium/4.2.0/org.osgi.compendium-4.2.0.jar">compendium
      </ulink> definitions.

    <para>
      This bundle can be configured the same way as the pure bundle as
      described in <xref linkend="agents-osgi-pure"/>. Additionally,
      the embedded Felix HttpService can be configured as described in
      its <ulink
      url="http://felix.apache.org/site/apache-felix-http-service.html#ApacheFelixHTTPService-ConfigurationProperties">documentation</ulink>. E.g. setting
      the port to 9090 instead of the default port 8080, a property
      <literal>org.osgi.service.http.port=9090</literal> needs to be
      set. This might be useful, if this bundle is used within
      containers which already occupy the default port (Glassfish,
      Eclipse Virgo) but don't expose an OSGi HttpService which could
      be consumed.

  <section id="agents-osgi-servlet">
    <title>Programmatic servlet registration</title>
    <para>
      It is also possible to register the Jolokia agent servlet
      manually instead of relying of the OSGi bundle activator which
      comes with the agents. For this use case
      <filename>jolokia-osgi.jar</filename> should be used. This
      bundle exports the package
      <classname>org.jolokia.osgi.servlet</classname> which includes
      the servlet class <classname>JolokiaServlet</classname>. This
      class has two constructors: A default constructor without
      arguments, one with a single
      <classname>BundleContext</classname> argument and finally one
      with an additional <classname>Restrictor</classname> (see <xref
      linkend="security-restrictor"/> for details how access
      restrictions can be applied). The constrcutros with a
      <classname>BundleContext</classname> as argument have the
      advantage, that they will use an OSGi
      <classname>LogService</classname> if available and adds various
      OSGi server detectors which adds serverinformations like product
      name and server version to the <literal>version</literal>
      command. Refer <xref linkend="version"/> for details about the
      server infos provided.
    </para>
    <para>
      Please note that for this use case the bundle
      <classname>org.jolokia.osgi</classname> should not be
      <emphasis>started</emphasis> but left in the state
      <emphasis>resolved</emphasis>. Otherwise, as soon as an OSGi
      HttpService registers, this bundle will try to add yet another
      agent servlet to this service which is probably not what you
      want. Alternatively, the bundle property
      <literal>org.jolokia.listenForHttpService</literal> can be set
      to <literal>false</literal> in which case there will be never an
      automatic servlet registration to an HttpService. 
    </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Restrictor service</title>
    <para>
      As described in <xref linkend="security-restrictor"/>, the
      Jolokia agent can use custom restrictors implementing the
      interface
      <classname>org.jolokia.restrictor.Restrictor</classname>. If the
      bundle property
      <literal>org.jolokia.useRestrictorService</literal> is set to
      true and no restrictor is configured by other means, the agent
      will use one or more OSGi service which register under the name
      <classname>org.jolokia.restrictor.Restrictor</classname>. If no
      such service is available, access to the agent is always
      denied. If one such restrictor service is available, the access
      decision is delegated to this service. When more than one
      restrictor service is available, access is ony granted if all of
      them individuallt grant access. A sample restrictor service as a
      maven project can be found in the Jolokia source at
      <filename>agent/osgi/restrictor-sample</filename>.
