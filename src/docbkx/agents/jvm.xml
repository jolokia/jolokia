  <title>JVM Agent</title>

  <para>
    The JVM agent is right agent when it comes to instrument an
    arbitrary Java application which is not covered by the other
    agents. This agent can be started by any Java program by
    providing certain startup options to the JVM. Or it can be
    dynamically attached (and detached) to an already running Java
    process. This universal agent uses the <ulink
    url="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jvmti/index.html">JVM
    agent API</ulink> and is available for every Sun/Oracle JVM 1.6
    and later.
  </para>

  <section id="jvm-agent">
    <title>Jolokia as JVM Agent</title>
    <para>
      The JVM agent uses the <ulink
      url="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jvmti/index.html">JVM
      Agent interface</ulink> for linking into any JVM. Under the
      hood it uses an HTTP-Server, which is available on every
      Oracle/Sun JVM from version 1.6 upwards.
    </para>
    <sidebar>
      The JDK embedded HTTP-Server is not the fastest one (it is used
      e.g. for the JAXWS reference implementation), but for our
      monitoring needs the performance is sufficient. There are
      several configuration options for tuning the HTTP server's
      performance. See below for details.
    </sidebar>
    <section id="jvm-agent-installation">
      <title>Installation</title>
      <para>
        This agent gets installed by providing a single startup option
        <literal>-javaagent</literal> when starting the Java process.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[
java -javaagent:agent.jar=port=7777,host=localhost]]></programlisting>
      <para>
        <filename>agent.jar</filename> is the filename of the Jolokia
        JVM agent. The agent can be downloaded like the others from the <ulink url="https://jolokia.org/download.html">download page</ulink>.
        When downloading from a Maven repository you need to check for the classifier <literal>agent</literal> (i.e. the
        jar to download looks like <filename>jolokia-jvm-1.3.1-agent.jar</filename>, not <filename>jolokia-jvm-1.1.5.jar</filename>).
        Options can be appended as a comma separated
        list. The available options are the same as described in <xref
        linkend="agent-war-init-params"/> plus the one described in
        table <xref linkend="agent-jvm-config"/>. If an options
        contains a comma, an equal sign or a backslash, it must be
        escaped with a backslash.

    <title>Attaching a Jolokia agent on the fly</title>
    <para>
      A Jolokia agent can be attached to any running Java process as
      long as the user has sufficient access privileges for
      accessing the process.  This agent uses the <ulink
      url="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/jdk/api/attach/spec/com/sun/tools/attach/VirtualMachine.html">Java
      attach API</ulink> for dynamically attaching and detaching to
      and from the process. It works similar to JConsole connecting
      to a local process. The Jolokia advantage is, that after the
      start of the agent, it can be reached over the network.

      The JAR containing the JVM  agent also contains a client
      application which can be reached via the

<pid/regexp> can be either a numeric process id or a regular expression. A regular expression is matched
against the processes' names (ignoring case) and must be specific enough to select exactly one process.

If no <command> is given but only a <pid> the state of the Agent will be toggled
between "start" and "stop"

If neither <command> nor <pid> is given, a list of Java processes along with their IDs
is printed

There are several possible reasons, why attaching to a process can fail:
   * The UID of this launcher must be the very *same* as the process to attach to. It's not sufficient
     to be root.
   * The JVM must have HotSpot enabled and be a JVM 1.6 or later.
   * It must be a Java process ;-)
