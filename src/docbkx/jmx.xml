  <para>
    The main focus of Jolokia is to allow easy access to JMX MBeans
    from everywhere. MBeans can be provided by the JVM itself, by an
    application server or an application itself, where each MBean is
    registered at a specific MBeanServer.  Multiple MBeanServers can
    co-exist in a single JVM. The so called
    <emphasis>PlatformMBeanServer</emphasis> is always present and is
    created by the JVM during startup. Especially application servers
    often create additional MBeanServers for various purposes. When
    accessing an MBean remotely via JSR-160, the MBeanServer holding
    the requested MBean must be known before. Jolokia instead
    <emphasis>merges</emphasis> all MBeanServers it can find to give a
    single view on all MBeans. The merging algorithm is described in
    <xref linkend="mbeanserver-merging"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
    For application specific MBeans, Jolokia provides an own, so
    called <emphasis>Jolokia MBeanServer</emphasis> which is treated
    specially by the Jolokia agent. The Jolokia MBeanServer and its
    features are explained in <xref linkend="jolokia-mbeanserver"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
    Developing application specific MBeans is easy, especially if
    <ulink
    url="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jmx/mbeans/standard.html">Standard
    MBeans</ulink> are used. However, for Spring users there is even a
    easier, more <ulink
    url="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.2.1.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/html/jmx.html">declarative
    way</ulink> for turning POJOs into MBeans. On top of this Jolokia
    provides an easy, declarative way for firing up a Jolokia JVM
    agent merely by including some Jolokia specific Spring
    configuration. This is described in <xref linkend="jvm-spring"/>.

      <title>JBoss 7 Gotcha</title>
      For JBoss 7 there is a slight issue when creating a new MBeanServer. For this to work,
      a <filename>jboss-deployment-structure</filename> with a dependency on
      <constant>org.jboss.as.jmx</constant> must be added. For an example see the
      <ulink url="https://github.com/rhuss/jolokia/blob/master/it/war/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/jboss-deployment-structure.xml">integration test war</ulink>, the location

      <listitem>
        Every MBean registered at the Jolokia MBeanServer will never
        show up remotely via JSR-160. The Jolokia MBeanServer is never
        exposed over JSR-160. 
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        Each Jolokia MBeanServer registered MBean will shadow any

      <listitem>
        The Jolokia MBeanServer is also responsible for managing so

        Jolokia tries hard to detect as many MBeanServer as available
        in a JVM. Beside the always present
        <classname>PlatformMBeanServer</classname> many 
        application servers create own MBeanServer which not always
        can be found with standard mechanisms. Therefore Jolokia comes
        with so called <classname>ServerDetector</classname>s for many
        known brands of applications server. These server detectors
        know how to find MBeanServer by application server specific
        means.
      </para>
      <para>
        The set of available of MBeanServers is detected during
        startup and kept, except for the Jolokia MBeanServer which can
        kick in and out at any time. For Jolokia operations, all these
        MBeanServers are tried according the order given below.

      <para>
        All MBeans contained in all detected MBeanServers are merged
        to give a single view on the set of available MBeans. 
        For MBeans registered with the same name at different
        MBeanServers, MBeans registered in later MBeanServers are not
        visible. These hidden MBeans will never be called on
        <constant>READ</constant>, <constant>WRITE</constant> or
        <constant>EXEC</constant> operations. Also, for
        <constant>LIST</constant> operations only the meta data of the

      <para>
        This hiding mechanism is used by

      JMX 1.4 introduced <ulink

      which allows for nearly arbitrary data to be translated into so
      called OpenData which are accessible via JMX. For example,
      arbitrary Java Beans are translated into a <ulink

      Jolokia provides an annotation <classname>@JsonMBean</classname>
      for marking an MBean as a JSON MBean. Such an MBean, if
      registered at the <emphasis>Jolokia MBeanServer</emphasis>
      creates a proxy on the <emphasis>PlatformMBeanServer</emphasis>
      where every complex value gets translated into plain strings in
      JSON format. This is true for attributes, operation return
      values and arguments. That way, a JSR-160 based console (like
      <command>jconsole</command>) can easily access complex data

      JsonMBean and MXBean are quite similar as both do a translation
      from complex data types to a standard format (OpenType for
      MXBeans, JSON strings for JsonMBean). However, there are also
      differences:

        MXBeans are a standard mechanism which are available on every

        <para>
          For JBoss prior to version 7 there are some slight issues
          since JBoss used to replace the standard MBeanServer with an
          own variant. See this <ulink

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        Serialisation of complex Java Beans is more powerful with
        JsonMBeans, e.g. Jolokia can detect self (or cyclic) object
        references. MXBeans will cause an error in this case.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        JsonMBeans must be added to the Jolokia MBeanServer to

      <listitem>
        JsonMBean work also with JMX support libraries which use

        JMX</ulink> uses a ModelMBean for

        There is an even simpler way to startup a Jolokia JVM agent

      <para>
        Beside putting this jar into the classpath (along with its
        dependencies) the only requirement is, that the Spring
        application context needs to pickup
        <filename>classpath:META-INF/spring/jolokia.xml</filename>. Luckily,
        many Spring based containers like the <ulink
        url="http://camel.apache.org/camel-maven-plugin.html">Camel
        Maven Plugin</ulink> do this automatically for you, nothing
        has to be configured here. Otherwise this
        application context path has to be added manually, but in this case it is
        probably easier to use the non-plugin version (without
        classifier) and declare the Jolokia server explicitily in an
        existing Spring configuration file as described above.
      </para>
      <para>
        By default, the Jolokia agent starts on port 8778 on every
        IP-Address of the host <emphasis>without</emphasis>
        security.
      </para>
      <para>
        The configuration can be tweaked via system properties as
        described in <xref
        linkend="jvm-spring-system-properties"/>. I.e. the plugin
        doesn't specify any configuration on its own and uses a
        <constant>systemPropertiesMode</constant> of
        "<constant>fallback</constant>". 
      </para>
      <para> 
        As an alternative, the default settings can be customized by
        providing a standalone
        <constant>&lt;jolokia:config&gt;</constant> somewhere in the
        Spring application context. An <constant>order</constant>
        attribute can be used if multiple config declarations are
        present: the higher the order, the higher the priority. But
        then again, instead of using the plugin with an external
        configuration it is probably better to us an explicite
        <constant>&lt;jolokia:agent&gt;</constant> declaration, since
        you have to add to a Spring configuration file anyway.
