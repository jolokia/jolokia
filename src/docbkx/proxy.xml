      Using Jolokia in the proxy mode enables for agentless operation
      on the target server. A dedicated agent deployment proxies by
      accepting Jolokia requests as input, translating them to JSR-160
      requests for the target. The principal setup is
      described in <xref linkend="architecture"/>. As noted there, the
      real target is given within the original request, which must be
      sent as a POST request.

      Agents of all types support the proxy mode. However, since one
      has usually the free choice of platform for a dedicated Jolokia
      proxy, an enviroment optimized for HTTP communication should be
      used. These are either servlet container or JEE server hosting
      the WAR agent or an OSGi runtime with an OSGi HttpService (which
      in turn is typically based on an embedded serlvet container like
      Tomcat or Jetty). The two other agents, the Mule and JDK6 agent
      are not that well suited for this job.

      All client libraries (jmx4perl, Java and Javascript) support the
      usage of the proxy mode in its API.

      <title>Limitations of the proxy mode</title>
      <para>
        The proxy mode has some limitations compared to the direct
        agent mode, so the agent mode it is recommended to use a
        direct agent deployment if possible. The limitations are:

          There is no automatic merging of JMX MBeanServers as in the case
          of the direct mode. Most application servers uses an own
          MBeanServer in addition to the
          <literal>PlatformMBeanServer</literal> (which is always
          present). Each MBean is registered only in one MBeanServer. The
          choice, which <literal>MBeanServer</literal> to use has to be
          given upfront, usually as a part of the JMX Service URL. But even
          then (as it is the case for JBoss 5.1) you might run into problem
          when selecting the proper MBeanServer.

          Proxying adds an additional remote layer which causes
          additional problems. I.e. the complex operations like
          <constant>list</constant> might fail in the proxy mode
          because of serialization issues. E.g. for JBoss it happens
          that certain MBeanInfo objects requested for the list
          operation are not serializable. This is a bug of JBoss, but
          I expect similar limitations for other application servers
          as well.

          Certain workarounds (like the JBoss "<emphasis>can not find
          MXBeans before MBeanInfo has been fetched</emphasis>" bug)
          works only in agent mode.

          It is astonishingly hard to set up an application server for
          JSR-160 export. And there are even cases (combinations of
          JDK and AppServer Version) which don't work at all properly
          (e.g. JDK 1.5 and JBoss 5). For certain application servers,
          detailed setup instructions are published at our <ulink
