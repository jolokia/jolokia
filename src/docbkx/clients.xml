    <title>Clients</title>

    <para>
      Three client implementations exists for Jolokia: Jmx4Perl, the
      Perl binding (the grandmother of all clients ;-), a Java library
      and a Javascript library. This reference describes the client
      bindings bundled with Jolokia. More JVM based client libraries
      are planned for inclusiong in Jolokia (e.g. Groovy, Scala or
      JRuby). Information about Jmx4Perl can be found <xref
      linkend="http://www.jmx4perl.org">elsewhere</xref>.
