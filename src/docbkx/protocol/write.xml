<section id="write">
  <title>Writing attributes (write)</title>
  <para>
    Writing an attribute is quite similar to reading one, except that the request takes an
    additional <constant>value</constant> element.
  </para>
  <section id="get-write">
    <title>GET write request</title>
      <para>
        Writing an attribute wit an GET request, an URL with the following format has to be used:         
        <synopsis><![CDATA[<base url>/write/<mbean name>/<attribute name>/<value>/<inner path>]]></synopsis>    
      </para>
      <table>
        <title>GET Write Request</title>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <td>Part</td>
            <td>Description</td>
            <td>Example</td>
          </tr>        
        </thead>
        <tr>
          <td><literal>&lt;mbean name&gt;</literal></td>
          <td>MBean's ObjectName</td>
          <td><literal>java.lang:type=ClassLoading</literal></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><literal>&lt;attribute name&gt;</literal></td>

          <td>
            The attribute name to value. The value must be serializable as described in 
            <xref linkend="serialization-request"/>.
          </td>
          <td><literal>true</literal></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><literal>&lt;path&gt;</literal></td>
          <td>   
            Inner path for accessing the parent object on which to set the value.
            (See also <xref linkend="paths"/>). Note, that this is
            <emphasis>not</emphasis> the path to the attribute itself,
            but to the object carrying this attribute. With a given
            path it is possible to deeply set an value on a complex
            object.

          <td></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <para>
        For example, you can set the garbage collector to verbose mode by using
        something like
        <informalexample>
          <literallayout class="monospaced">http://localhost:8080/jolokia/write/java.lang:type=Memory/Verbose/true</literallayout>
        </informalexample>
      </para>

    <section id="post-write">
      <title>POST write request</title>
      <para>
        The keys which are evaluated for a POST write request are:

          <td>   
            An optional inner path for specifying an inner object on which to set the
            value. See <xref linkend="paths"/> for more on inner paths.

    <section id="response-write">
      <title>Write response</title>
      <para>
        As response for a write operation the old attribute's value is
        returned. For a request
        <synopsis><![CDATA[http://localhost:8080/jolokia/write/java.lang:type=ClassLoading/Verbose/true]]></synopsis>
        you get the answer (supposed that verbose mode was switched
        off for class loading at the time this request was sent)
      </para>
      <programlisting><![CDATA[
 { 
   "value":"false",
   "status":200,
   "request": {
                "mbean":"java.lang:type=ClassLoading",
                "type":"write",
                "attribute":"Verbose",
                "value":true
              }
 }]]></programlisting>
      <para>
        The response is quite similar to the read operation except for
        the additional <constant>value</constant> element in the request
        (and of course, the different <constant>type</constant>).
