    <title>Security</title>

    <para>
      Security in JSR-160 remoting is an all-or-nothing option. Either
      all or none of your MBeans are accessible (except when your application server
      uses a SecurityManager, but that is not often the case). Jolokia, on
      the other hand, allows for fine grained security defined in an
      XML security policy file. It allows for access restrictions on
      MBean names (or patterns), attributes, operations, source IP
      address (or a subnet) and type of Jolokia operation.
    </para>

    <section id="security-policy">
      <title>Policy based security</title>
      <para>
        Access to MBean and to the Jolokia agents in general can be
        restricted with an XML policy file. This policy can be configured
        for various parameters and is divided into several sections.
      </para>
      <section>
        <title>IP based restrictions</title>
        <para>
          Overall access can be granted based on the IP address of an
          HTTP client. These restrictions are
          specified within a <literal>&lt;remote&gt;</literal> section,
          which contains one or more <literal>&lt;host&gt;</literal>
          elements. The source can be given either as an IP address,
          a host name, or a netmask given in
          <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing">CIDR format</ulink>
          (e.g. "10.0.0.0/16" for all clients coming from the 10.0
          network). The following allows access from localhost and all
          clients whose IP addresses start with "10.0". For all other
          IP addresses access is denied.

        <title>Commands</title>
        <para>
          This section specifies the Jolokia commands for which access
          is generally granted. For each command in the list, access can
          be further restricted within the
          <literal>&lt;deny&gt;</literal> part and each command
          missing in the list, which is forbidden globally, can be
          selectively enabled for certain MBeans in the
          <literal>&lt;allow&gt;</literal> section. If the
          <literal>&lt;commands&gt;</literal> section is missing
          completely, access to all commands is allowed.

      <section>
        <title>Allow and deny access to certain MBeans</title>
        <para>
          Within an <literal>&lt;allow&gt;</literal> section, access
          to MBeans can be granted regardless of the
          operations specified in the
          <literal>&lt;commands&gt;</literal> section. The reverse is
          true for the <literal>&lt;deny&gt;</literal> section: It
          rejects access to the MBeans specified here. Both sections
          contain one or more <literal>&lt;mbean&gt;</literal>
          elements which have a format like:
        </para>
        <programlisting><![CDATA[
<mbean>
  <name>java.lang:type=Memory</name>
  <attribute>*Memory*</attribute>
  <attribute mode="read">Verbose</attribute>
  <operation>gc</operation>
</mbean>
]]></programlisting>
        <para>
          Within the <literal>&lt;name&gt;</literal> section the name
          of the MBean is specified. This can bei either a complete
          ObjectName or a MBean pattern containing wildcards. The
          value given here must conform to the JMX specification for a
          valid <classname>ObjectName</classname>. On this MBean (or
          <emphasis>MBeans</emphasis> if <literal>name</literal> is a pattern),
          attributes are specified within one or more
          <literal>&lt;attribute&gt;</literal> elements and operations
          within one or more <literal>&lt;operation&gt;</literal>
          elements. The content can also be a pattern, which uses a wildcard
          <literal>*</literal>. e.g. <literal>&lt;attribute&gt;*&lt;/attribute&gt;</literal>
          specifies all attributes on the given MBean. If for an
          <literal>&lt;attribute&gt;</literal> element the XML
          attribute <literal>mode="read"</literal> is given, then this
          attribute can be accessed only read-only.
        </para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>HTTP method restrictions</title>
        <para>
          Finally, access can be restricted based on the HTTP method
          with which an Jolokia request was received with the
          <literal>&lt;http&gt;</literal> element. Method allowed
          (<literal>post</literal> or <literal>get</literal>) are
          specified with an <literal>&lt;method&gt;</literal> inner
          element. The following example restricts the access to POST
          requests only:
        </para>
        <programlisting><![CDATA[
<http>
  <method>post</method>
</http>
]]></programlisting>
        <para>
          It the <literal>&lt;http&gt;</literal> section is missing
          completely, any HTTP method can be used.
        </para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions</title>
        <para>
          Jolokia (since version 1.0.3) supports the W3C specification
          for <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">Cross-Origin
          Resource Sharing</ulink> (also known as "CORS") which allows
          browser to access resources which are located on a different
          server than the calling script is loaded from. This
          specification provides a controlled way to come around the
          <emphasis>same origin policy</emphasis>. Most <ulink
          url="http://caniuse.com/#search=CORS">contemporary
          browsers</ulink> support CORS.
        </para>

        <para>
          By default Jolokia allows cross origin access from any
          host. This can be limited to certain hosts by using
          <literal>&lt;allow-origin&gt;</literal> sections within a
          <literal>&lt;cors&gt;</literal> sections. This tags can
          contain the origin URL provided by browsers with the
          <literal>Origin:</literal> header literally or a
          wildcard specification with <literal>*</literal>.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[
<cors>
   <!-- Allow cross origin access from www.jolokia.org ... -->
   <allow-origin>http://www.jolokia.org</allow-origin>

   <!-- ... and all servers from jmx4perl.org with any protocol ->
   <allow-origin>*://*.jmx4perl.org</allow-origin>

   <!-- Check for the proper origin on the server side, too -->
   <strict-checking/>
</cors>
]]></programlisting>
        <para>
          If the option <literal>&lt;strict-checking/&gt;</literal> is given in this section, too, then the given patterns
          are not only used for CORS checking but also every request is checked on the server side whether the
          <literal>Origin:</literal> or <literal>Referer:</literal> header matches one of the given patterns.
          If neither <literal>Origin:</literal> nor <literal>Referer:</literal> is given and strict checking is enabled, then the access is denied. This useful for protecting against Cross-Site Request Forgery.
        </para>
        <para>
          Please note that <literal>&lt;strict-checking/&gt;</literal> might not be good enough because of potential
          browser bugs which could allow to forge the origin header. Examples of these issues are
          <ulink url="https://blog.bentkowski.info/2018/06/setting-arbitrary-request-headers-in.html">arbitrary header injection</ulink>
          or <ulink url="https://www.brokenbrowser.com/referer-spoofing-defeating-xss-filter/">referer and origin
          spoofing</ulink>. User facing application which uses Jolokia has backend should consider to implement
          additional measures like using the
          <ulink url="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-first-party-cookies-07">same-site</ulink> flag
          on the session cookie.

          <para>
            A great tool which helps in repackaging an agent for
            inclusion of a <literal>jolokia-access.xml</literal>
            policy file
            is the command line tool <ulink
            url="http://search.cpan.org/~roland/jmx4perl/scripts/jolokia">jolokia</ulink>,
            which comes with the <ulink

          </para>
        </sidebar>
        <para>
          But how do the agents lookup the policy file ? By default,
          the agents will lookup for a policy file top-level in the
          classpath under the name
          <filename>jolokia-access.xml</filename>. Hence for the war
          agent, the policy file must be packaged within the war at
          <filename>WEB-INF/classes/jolokia-access.xml</filename>, for
          all other agents at
          <filename>/jolokia-access.xml</filename>. The location can
          be overwritten with the configuration parameter
          <literal>policyLocation</literal>, which has to be set
          differently depending on the agent type. Please refer to
          <xref linkend="agents"/> for more details. The value of this
          init parameter can be any URL which can loaded by the JVM. A
          special case is an URL with the scheme
          <literal>classpath:</literal> which results in a lookup of
          the policy file within the classpath. As stated above, the
          default value of this parameter is
          <literal>classpath:/jolokia-access.xml</literal>. If a
          non-classpath URL is provided with this parameter, and the
          target policy file could not be found then access is
          completely denied. If a classpath lookup fails then access
          is globally granted and a warning is given on standard
          output.

      <title>Jolokia Restrictors</title>
      <para>
        In order to provide fine grained security, Jolokia using the
        abstract concept of an <emphasis>Restrictor</emphasis>. It is
        represented by the Java interface
        <classname>org.jolokia.restrictor.Restrictor</classname> and
        comes with several implementations. The most prominent one is
        the <classname>PolicyRestrictor</classname> which is described
        in <xref linkend="security-policy"/>. This is also the
        restrictor which is active by default. For special needs, it is
        possible to provide a custom implementation of this
        interface for the WAR and OSGi agents. It is recommended to
        subclass either
        <classname>org.jolokia.restrictor.AllowAllRestrictor</classname>
        or
        <classname>org.jolokia.restrictor.DenyAllRestrictor</classname>.
      </para>
      <para>
        For the WAR agent (<xref linkend="agents-war"/>), a subclass
        of <classname>org.jolokia.http.AgentServlet</classname> should
        be created which overrides the
        <methodname>createRestrictor()</methodname>
      </para>
      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
public class RestrictedAgentServlet extends AgentServlet {

    @Override

    }
}]]></programlisting>
      <para>
        <literal>policyLocation</literal> is a URL pointing to the
        policy file, which is either the default value
        <filename>classpath:/jolokia-access.xml</filename> or the
        value specified with the init parameter
        <literal>policyLocation</literal>. This servlet can then be
        easily configured in a custom <filename>web.xml</filename>
        the same way as the Jolokia agent.
      </para>
      <para>
        For programmatic usage there is an even simpler way:
        <classname>AgentServlet</classname> provides an constructor
        which takes an restrictor as argument, so no sublcassing is
        required in this case.
      </para>
      <para>
        For an OSGi agent (<xref linkend="agents-osgi"/>),
        <classname>org.jolokia.osgi.servlet.JolokiaServlet</classname>
        is the proper extension point. It can be subclassed the same
        way as shown above and allows a restrictor implementation as
        constructor parameter, too. In contrast to
        <classname>AgentServlet</classname> this class is also OSGi
        exported and can be referenced from other
        bundles. Additionally, the OSGi agent can also pick up a
        restrictor as an OSGi service. See <xref
        linkend="agents-osgi"/> for details.
