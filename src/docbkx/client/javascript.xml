  <title>Javascript Client Library</title>
  <para>
    The Jolokia Javascript library provides a Javascript API to the 
    to the Jolokia agent. It comes with two layers, a
    basic one which allows for sending Jolokia requests to the agent
    synchronously or asynchronously and one with a simplified API
    which is less powerful but easier to use. This library supports
    bulk requests, HTTP GET and POST requests and JSONP for querying
    agents which are located on a different server.
  </para>
  <para>
    All methods of this library are available via the
    <classname>Jolokia</classname> client object, which needs to be
    instantiated up-front. In the following example a client object is
    created and the used heap memory is requested synchronously via
    the simple API. The agent is deployed within the same webarchive
    which also serves this script.

    <para>
      A Jolokia client is always created as an instance of
      <classname>Jolokia</classname>. Requests to the agent are sent
      by calling methods on this object. The constructing function
      takes a plain object, which provides default parameters which
      are used in the <methodname>request()</methodname> if no
      overriding are given there.

    <title>Usage</title>
    <para>
      All function of this library are available as methods of the
      <classname>Jolokia</classname> object. The options needs to be
      instantiated as usual and takes a set of default options, which
      can be overwritten by subsequent requests. On the most basic
      layer is a single <methodname>request()</methodname> method,
      which takes two arguments: A request object and an optional
      option object. For example, a synchronous request for obtaining
      the agent's version for a agent running on the same server which
      delivered the Javascript looks like:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="javascript"><![CDATA[
var j4p = new Jolokia({url: "/jolokia"});
var response = j4p.request({type: "version"},{method: "post"});
console.log("Agent Version: " + response.value.agent);]]></programlisting>
    <para>
      If the constructor is used with a single string argument, this
      value is considered to be the agent's access URL. I.e. in the
      example above the construction of the
      <classname>Jolokia</classname> could have been performed with a
      single string argument (<code>new Jolokia("/jolokia")</code>).
    </para>
    <section id="js-request-format">
      <title>Requests</title>
      <para>
        Jolokia requests and responses are represented as JSON
        objects. They have exactly the same format, which is expected
        and returned by the agent as defined in <xref
        linkend="protocol"/> for POST requests. All request types are
        supported.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <methodname>request()</methodname> expects as its first
        argument either a single request object or, for bulk requests,
        an array of request objects. Depending on this for synchronous
        operations either a single response JSON object is returned or
        an array of responses (in the order of the initial request
        array). For asynchronous request one or more callbacks are
        called for each response separately. See <xref
        linkend="js-request-sync-async"/> for details.

            are not possible with "post" (which obviously implies that

            using a <constant>read</constant> type request for multiple
            attributes, this also can only be sent as "post"
            requests. If not given, a HTTP method is determined

      Requests can be send either synchronously or asynchronously via
      Ajax. If a <constant>success</constant> callback is given in the
      request options, the request is performed asynchronously via an
      Ajax HTTP request. The callback gets these arguments: a Jolokia JSON
      response object (see <xref linkend="request-response"/>) and an
      integer index indicating for which response this callback is being
      called. For bulk requests, this index corresponds to the array
      index of the request which lead to this response. The value of
      this option can be an array of callback functions which are
      called in a round robin fashion when multiple responses are
      received in case of bulk requests. These callbacks are called
      only when the returned Jolokia response has a status code of
      <constant>200</constant>, otherwise the callback(s) given with
      the <constant>error</constant> option are consulted. If no error
      callback is given, the error is printed on the console by
      default. As for success callbacks, error callbacks reveive the
      Jolokia error response as a JSON object.

      Both callbacks, <constant>success</constant> and
      <constant>error</constant>, are only called when the Ajax
      request succeeds. In case of an error on the HTTP level, the
      callback <constant>ajaxError</constant> is called with the
      <classname>XMLHttpRequest</classname>, a
      <constant>textStatus</constant> and an optional exception
      object. It has the same signature as the underlying
      <constant>error</constant> callback of the
      <code>jQuery.ajax()</code> call. (See the <ulink
      url="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/">jQuery documentation</ulink>
      for details).
    </para>
    <para>
      The Jolokia agent also supports <ulink
      url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">JSONP</ulink> requests
      for cases where the Jolokia agent is served on a different server or port
      than the Javascript client. By default, such access is forbidden by the so called
      <emphasis>same-origin-policy</emphasis>. To swith on JSONP, the
      option <constant>jsonp</constant> should be set to

    </para>
    <para>
      As explained in <xref linkend="request-response"/> the Jolokia
      agent supports two HTTP methods, <constant>GET</constant> and
      <constant>POST</constant>. <constant>POST</constant> is more
      powerful since it supports more features. e.g. bulk requests and
      JMX proxy requests are only possible with POST. By default, the
      Jolokia Javascript library selects an HTTP method automatically,
      which is <code>GET</code> for simple cases and <code>POST</code>
      for more sophisticated requests. The HTTP method can be
      overridden by setting the option <constant>method</constant> to
      <constant>"get"</constant> or <constant>"post"</constant>.
    </para>
    <para>
      There are some limitations in choosing the HTTP method depending

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        Bulk requests (i.e. an array of multiple requests) can only be

      <listitem>
        <constant>READ</constant> requests for multiple attributes
        (i.e. the <constant>attribute</constant> request parameter is

      <listitem>
        The JMX proxy mode (see <xref linkend="proxy"/>) can only be used

        JSONP can only be used with <constant>GET</constant> and only

        technique itself.
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

      For maven users' convenience, the Jolokia Javascript package is

      Unfortunately, the "offical" version of this plugin hosted on
      Codehaus has been stuck at version
        <code>1.0-alpha-1-SNAPSHOT</code>. Although it is quite
        usable, in order to avoid a snapshot dependency, it is
        recommended to use a fork of this plugin hosted on <ulink
        url="https://github.com/harlanji/javascript-test-maven-plugin">GitHub</ulink> and deployed at the 
        <ulink url="https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public">Sonatype Maven repository</ulink>.
