  <title>Agents</title>
  
  <para>
    Jolokia is an agent based approach to JMX, which requires to
    install an extra piece of software, the
    <emphasis>agent</emphasis>. This software either needs to be
    deployed on the target server which should be accessed via remote
    JMX (<xref linkend="agent-mode"/>). Or it can be installed on a
    dedicated proxy server (<xref linkend="proxy-mode"/>). For both
    operational modes, there exist four different kind of
    agents<footnote>
      <para>
        Although the proxy mode is available for all four agents, you
        are normally free to setup the proxy environment. The
        recommendation here is the war-agent for which very
        lightweight servlet container exists. Tomcat or Jetty are both
        a perfect choice for a Jolokia proxy server.

      <term><emphasis role="bold">Webarchive (War) agent</emphasis></term>
      <listitem>
        This agent is packaged as a JEE Webarchive (War). It is the
        standard installation artifact for Java webapplicaton and
        problem one of the best known deployment format. Jolokia ships
        with an war-agent, which can be deployed like any other web
        application. This agent has been tested on a wealth of JEE
        servers, well known market leaders and more seldom species.

      <term><emphasis role="bold">OSGi agent</emphasis></term>
      <listitem>
        <ulink url="">OSGi</ulink> is a middleware specification
        focussing on modularity and a well defined dynamic lifecycle
        <footnote>
          <para>
            Of course, there is much more on OSGi, a platform and
            programing model which I <emphasis>really</emphasis>
            like. So to say, this is my personal pet agent ;-).
          </para>
        </footnote>.  The Jolokia OSGi agent bundles comes in two
        flavors: One minimal one with the dependency on a running
        <ulink url="">OSGi HttpService</ulink>, and a all-in-one
        bundle including an embedded HttpServer (which is not
        exported). The former is the recommended, puristic solution,
        the later is provided for a quick startup for initial testing
        the OSGi agent (but should be replaced with the minimal bundle
        for production setups).

      <term><emphasis role="bold">Mule agent</emphasis></term>
      <listitem>
        <ulink url="">Mule</ulink> is one of the leading Open Source
        Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). It provides a management api
        into which a dedicated Jolokia agent plugs in nicely. This
        agent includes an embedded Jetty for providing JMX HTTP
        access.

      <term><emphasis role="bold">JVM JDK6 agent</emphasis></term>
      <listitem>
        Starting with Java 6 the JDK provided by Sun
        (now Oracle) contains a lightweight HTTP-Server which is used
        e.g. for reference WebService stack included in Java
        6. Together with the Java-agent API (normally used by
        profilers and other development tools requiring the
        instrumentation during class loading phase), the JVM 6 Jolokia
        agent is the most generic one. It is able to instrument
        <emphasis>any</emphasis> Java application running on a
        Sun/Oralce JDK 6<footnote>
        <para>
          You could even instrument a JEE application server this way,
          however this is not recommended.
        </para>
        </footnote>.
        It is fully feature, however tends to be a bit slow since the
        provided HTTP-Server is not optimized for performance. However
        it is useful for servers like Hadoop or Teracotta which does
        not provide a convenient hook for an HTTP exporting agent.
