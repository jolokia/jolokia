  <title>Agents</title>

  <para>
    Jolokia is an agent based approach to JMX, which requires that clients
    install an extra piece of software, the so-called
    <emphasis>agent</emphasis>. This software either needs to be
    deployed on the target server which should be accessed via remote
    JMX (<xref linkend="agent-mode"/>), or it can be installed on a
    dedicated proxy server (<xref linkend="proxy-mode"/>). For both
    operational modes, there are four different kind of
    agents<footnote>
      <para>
        Although the proxy mode is available for all four agents, you
        are normally free to setup the proxy environment. The
        recommendation here is the war-agent for which very
        lightweight servlet container exists. Tomcat or Jetty are both
        a perfect choice for a Jolokia proxy server.

      <term><emphasis role="bold">Webarchive (War) agent</emphasis></term>
      <listitem>
        This agent is packaged as a Java EE Webarchive (War). It is the
        standard installation artifact for Java webapplications and
        probably one of the best known deployment formats. Jolokia ships
        with a war-agent which can be deployed like any other web
        application. This agent has been tested on many Java EE
        servers, from well-known market leaders to rarer species.

            Of course, there is much more to OSGi, a platform and
            programing model which I <emphasis>really</emphasis>
            like. This is my personal pet agent, so to speak ;-).

        </footnote>.  The Jolokia OSGi agent bundles comes in two
        flavors: a minimal one with a dependency on a running

        url="http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v42/org/osgi/service/http/HttpService.html">OSGi
        HttpService</ulink>, and a all-in-one bundle including an
        embedded <emphasis>HttpService</emphasis> implementation
        (which is exported, too). The former is the recommended,
        puristic solution, the later is provided for a quick startup
        for initial testing the OSGi agent (but should be replaced
        with the minimal bundle for production setups).

        agent includes an embedded Jetty for providing JMX HTTP

      <term><emphasis role="bold">JVM agent</emphasis></term>
      <listitem>
        Starting with Java 6 the JDK provided by Oracle contains a
        lightweight HTTP-Server which is used e.g. for the reference
        WebService stack implementation included in Java 6. Using
        the Java-agent API (normally used by profilers and other
        development tools requiring the instrumentation during the
        class loading phase), the JVM 6 Jolokia agent is the most
        generic one. It is able to instrument <emphasis>any</emphasis>
        Java application running on a Oracle JDK 6<footnote>
        <para>
          You could even instrument a Java EE application server this way,
          however this is not recommended.
        </para>
        </footnote>.
        This Jolokia agent variant is fully featured, however tends to
        be a bit slow since the
        provided HTTP-Server is not optimized for performance. However
        it is useful for servers like Hadoop or Teracotta, which do
        not provide convenient hooks for an HTTP-exporting agent on
        their own.
