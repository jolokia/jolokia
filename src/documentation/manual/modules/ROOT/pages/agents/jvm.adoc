== JVM Agent

The JVM agent is right agent when it comes to instrument an
arbitrary Java application which is not covered by the other
agents. This agent can be started by any Java program by
providing certain startup options to the JVM. Or it can be
dynamically attached (and detached) to an already running Java
process. This universal agent uses the
https://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jvmti/index.html[JVM
agent API] and is available for every Sun/Oracle JVM 1.6
and later.

[#jvm-agent]
=== Jolokia as JVM Agent

The JVM agent uses the
https://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jvmti/index.html[JVM
Agent interface] for linking into any JVM. Under the
hood it uses an HTTP-Server, which is available on every
Oracle/Sun JVM from version 1.6 upwards.

****
The JDK embedded HTTP-Server is not the fastest one (it is used
e.g. for the JAXWS reference implementation), but for our
monitoring needs the performance is sufficient. There are
several configuration options for tuning the HTTP server's
performance. See below for details.
****

[#jvm-agent-installation]
==== Installation

This agent gets installed by providing a single startup option
`-javaagent` when starting the Java process.

----
java -javaagent:agent.jar=port=7777,host=localhost
----

`agent.jar` is the filename of the Jolokia
JVM agent. The agent can be downloaded like the others from the https://jolokia.org/download.html[download page].
When downloading from a Maven repository you need to check for the classifier `agent` (i.e. the
jar to download looks like `jolokia-jvm-1.3.1-agent.jar`, not `jolokia-jvm-1.1.5.jar`).
Options can be appended as a comma separated
list. The available options are the same as described in
<<agent-war-init-params>> plus the one described in
table <<agent-jvm-config>>. If an options
contains a comma, an equal sign or a backslash, it must be
escaped with a backslash.

[#agent-jvm-config]
.JVM agent configuration options
|===
|Parameter|Description|Example

|`agentContext`
|Context under which the agent is deployed. The full URL
will be `protocol://host:port/agentContext`. The default context is
`/jolokia`.
|`/j4p`

|`agentId`
|A unique ID for this agent. By default a unique id is
calculated. If provided it should be ensured that this id is
unique among all agent reachable via multicast requests used
by the discovery mechanism. It is recommended not to set
this value. Within the `agentId` specification you
can use the same placeholders as in `discoveryAgentUrl`.
|`my-unique-agent-id`

|`agentDescription`
|An optional description which can be used for clients to
present a human readable label for this agent.
|`Intranet Timebooking Server`

|`host`
|Hostaddress to which the HTTP server should bind to. If "*" or "0.0.0.0" is
given, the servers binds to every network interface.
|`localhost`

|`port`
|Port the HTTP server should listen to. If set to 0, then an arbitrary free port
will be selected.
|`8778`

|`user`
|User to be used for authentication (along with a `password`)
|

|`password`
|Password used for authentication (`user` is then required, too)
|

|`realm`
|Sets the security realm to use. If the `authMode` is set to
`jaas` this is also used as value for the security domain.
E.g. for Karaf 3 and later, this realm should be `karaf` since
all JMX MBeans are guarded by this security domain.
|`jolokia`

|`authMode`
|Can be either `basic` (the default), `jaas` or `delegate`. If
`jaas` is used, the user and password given in the `Authorization:`
header are used for login in via JAAS and, if successful, the return subject is used for all Jolokia operation.
This has only an effect, if user is set. For authentication mode `delegate`, the authentication
decision is delegated to a service specified by `authUrl` (see below for details).
|`basic`

|`authMatch`
|If MultiAuthenticator is used, this config item explains how to combine multiple authenticators.
Supported values: `any` at least one authenticator must match, `all`
all authenticators must match.
|`any`

|`authClass`
|Fully qualified name of an authenticator class. Class must be on classpath and must extend
`com.sun.net.httpserver.Authenticator`. Class can declare a constructor
that takes one argument of a type `org.jolokia.core.config.Configuration` in which case
Jolokia runtime configuration will be passed (useful in cases where authenticator requires additional
configuration). If no such constructor is found, default (no-arg) constructor will be use to create an
instance.
|

|`authUrl`
|URL of a service used for checking the authentication. This configuration option is only effective if
`authMode` is set to `delegate`. This URL can have a HTTP or HTTPS scheme.
The initially provided `Authorization:` header is copied over to the request against this
URL.
|

|`authPrincipalSpec`
a|Expression used for extracting a principal name from the response of a delegate authentication service. This
parameter is only in use when the `authMode` is set to `delegate`. The
following expressions are supported:

`json:path`:: a path into a JSON response which points to the principal.
E.g. a principal spec `jason:metadata/name` will select the "name" property within the JSON
object specified by the "metadata" property. For navigate into arrays, numeric indexes can be used.
`empty:`:: Always extracts an empty (`""`) principal.
If this option is not specified, not principal is extracted.
|

|`authIgnoreCerts`
|If given, the `authMode` is set to `delegate` and the delegate URL is
as HTTPS-URL then the server certificate as well as the server's DNS name will not be verified. This useful
in order to avoid (or introduce) complex keymanagement issues, but is of course less secure. By default
certs a verified with the local keystore.
|

|`protocol`
|HTTP protocol to use. Should be either `http`
or `https`. For the SSL stack there are various
additional configuration options.
|`http`

|`backlog`
|Size of request backlog before requests get discarded.
|`10`

|`executor`
a|Threading model of the HTTP server:

`fixed`:: Thread pool with a fixed number of threads (see also `threadNr`)
`cached`:: Cached thread pool which creates threads on demand
`single`:: A single thread only
|`single`

|`threadNamePrefix`
|Thread name prefix that executor will use while creating new thread(s).
|`jolokia-`

|`threadNr`
|Number of threads to be used when the
`fixed` execution model is chosen.
|`5`

|`keystore`
|Path to the SSL keystore to use (https only)
|

|`keystorePassword`
|Keystore password (https only). If the password is given embedded in brackets `pass:[[[...]]]`,
then it is treated as an encrypted password which was encrypted with `java -jar jvm-agent.jar
encrypt`. See below for details.
|

|`useSslClientAuthentication`
|Whether client certificates should be used for
authentication. The presented certificate is validated that it is signed by
a known CA which must be in the keystore (https only). (`true` or
`false`).
|`false`

|`secureSocketProtocol`
|Secure protocol that will be used for establishing HTTPS connection (https only)
|`TLS`

|`keyStoreType`
|SSL keystore type to use (https only)
|`JKS`

|`keyManagerAlgorithm`
|Key manager algorithm (https only)
|`SunX509`

|`trustManagerAlgorithm`
|Trust manager algorithm (https only)
|`SunX509`

|`caCert`
|If HTTPs is to be used and no `keystore` is given, then `caCert`
can be used to point to a PEM encoded CA certification file. This is use to verify
client certificates when `useSslClientAuthentication` is switched on (https only)
|

|`serverCert`
|For SSL (and when no `keyStore` is used) then this path must point to server
certificate which is presented to clients (https only)
|

|`serverKey`
|Path to the PEM encoded key file for signing the server cert during TLS handshake. This is only
used when no `keyStore` is used. For decrypting the key the password given with
`keystorePassword` is used (https only).
|

|`serverKeyAlgorithm`
|Encryption algorithm to use for decrypting the key given with `serverKey`
(https only)
|`RSA`

|`clientPrincipal`
|The principal which must be given in a client certificate to allow access to the agent. This can be one or
or more relative distinguished names (RDN), separated by commas. The subject of a given client certificate
must match on all configured RDNs. For example, when the configuration is `O=jolokia.org,OU=Dev` then a
client certificate's subject must contain `O=jolokia.org` and `OU=Dev` to allow the request. Multiple alternative
principals can be configured by using additional options with consecutive index suffix like in
`clientPrincipal.1`, `clientPrincipal.2`, ... Please remember that a `,`
separating RDNs must be escaped with a backslash (`\,`) when used on the commandline as agent arguments.
(https and useSslAuthentication only)
|

|`extraClientCheck`
|If switched on the agent performs an extra check for client authentication that the presented client
cert contains a client flag in the extended key usage section which must be present.
(https and useSslAuthentication only)
|

|`bootAmx`
|If set to `true` and if the agent is
attached to a GlassFish server, then during startup the
AMX subsystem is booted so that GlassFish specific MBeans
are available. Otherwise, if set to
`false` the AMX system is not booted.
|`true`


|`config`
|Path to a properties file from where the configuration
options should be read. Such a property file can contain
the configuration options as described here as key value
pairs (except for the `config` property
of course :)
|

|`discoveryEnabled`
|Is set to `false` then this agent will
not listen for multicast request (multicast-group 239.192.48.84,
port 24884 by default, but can configured individually).
By default this option is enabled. This option can also be switched on with an
environment variable
`JOLOKIA_DISCOVERY` or the system
property `jolokia.discoveryEnabled` set to
`true`.
|Default: `true`

|`discoveryAgentUrl`
|Sets the URL to respond for multicast discovery requests. If
given, `discoveryEnabled` is set
implicitly to true. This URL can also be provided by an
environment variable
`JOLOKIA_DISCOVERY_AGENT_URL` or the system
property `jolokia.discoveryUrl`. Within the value you can use the
placeholders `$\{host}` and `$\{ip}` which gets replaced
by the autodetected local host name/address. Also with `$\{env:ENV_VAR}` and
`$\{sys:property}` environment and system properties can be referenced, respectively.
|`http://10.9.11.87:8778/jolokia`

|`multicastGroup`
|The multicast group IPv4 address. This group IP can be also given as an environment variable `JOLOKIA_MULTICAST_GROUP` or a system property `jolokia.multicastGroup`
|`239.192.48.84`

|`multicastPort`
|The multicast port. This port can be also given as an environment variable `JOLOKIA_MULTICAST_PORT` or a system property `jolokia.multicastPort`
|`24884`

|`sslProtocol`
|The list of SSL / TLS protocols enabled. Valid options are available in the documentation
on SunJSSEProvider for your JDK version. Using only `TLSv1.1` and
`TLSv1.2` is recommended in Java 1.7 and Java 1.8. Using only
`TLSv1` is recommended in Java 1.6. Multiple protocols can be configured
by using additional options with consecutive index suffixes like in
`sslProtocol.1`, `sslProtocol.2`, ...
|`TLSv1.2`

|`sslCipherSuite`
|The list of SSL / TLS cipher suites to enable. The table of available cipher suites is
available under the "Default Enabled Cipher Suites" at the SunJSSEProvider documentation
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/SunProviders.html#SunJSSEProvider[here].
Multiple cipher suites can be configured by using additional options with consecutive index
suffixes like in `sslCipherSuite.1`, `sslCipherSuite.2`, ...
|

|`policyLocation`
|Path to the XML policy file
|
|===

Upon successful startup the agent will print out a success
message with the full URL which can be used by clients for
contacting the agent.

[#jvm-attach]
=== Attaching a Jolokia agent on the fly

A Jolokia agent can be attached to any running Java process as
long as the user has sufficient access privileges for
accessing the process. This agent uses the
https://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/jdk/api/attach/spec/com/sun/tools/attach/VirtualMachine.html[Java
attach API] for dynamically attaching and detaching to
and from the process. It works similar to JConsole connecting
to a local process. The Jolokia advantage is, that after the
start of the agent, it can be reached over the network.

The JAR containing the JVM  agent also contains a client
application which can be reached via the
`-jar` option. Call it with
`--help` to get a short usage information:

<pid/regexp> can be either a numeric process id or a regular expression. A regular expression is matched
against the processes' names (ignoring case) and must be specific enough to select exactly one process.

If no <command> is given but only a <pid> the state of the Agent will be toggled
between "start" and "stop"

If neither <command> nor <pid> is given, a list of Java processes along with their IDs
is printed

There are several possible reasons, why attaching to a process can fail:
* The UID of this launcher must be the very *same* as the process to attach to. It's not sufficient
to be root.
* The JVM must have HotSpot enabled and be a JVM 1.6 or later.
* It must be a Java process ;-)

For more documentation please visit www.jolokia.org
----

Every option described in <<agent-jvm-config>>
is reflected by a command line option for the
launcher. Additionally, the option `--quiet`
can be used to keep the launcher silent and
`--verbose` for adding some extra logging.

The launcher knows various operational modes, which needs to
be provided as a non-option argument and possibly require an
extra argument.

`start`::
Use this to attach an agent to an already running, local
Java process. The additional argument is either the
_process id_ of the Java process to
attach to or a _regular expression_
which is matched against the Java processes names. In the
later case, exactly one process must match, otherwise an
exception is raised. The command will return with an
return code of 0 if an agent has been started. If the
agent is already running, nothing happens and the launcher
returns with 1. The URL of the Agent will be printed to
standard out on an extra line except when the
`--quiet` option is used.

`stop`::
Command for stopping an running and dynamically attached
agent. The required argument is the Java process id or
an regular expression as described for the
`start` command. If the agent could be
stopped, the launcher exits with 0, it exits with 1 if
there was no agent running.

`toggle`::
Starts or stops an dynamically attached agent,
depending on its current state. The Java process ID is
required as an additional argument. If an agent is
running, `toggle` will stop it (and
vice versa). The launcher returns with an exit code of 0
except when the operation fails. When the agent is
started, the full agent's URL is printed to standard
out. `toggle` is the default command
when only a numeric process id is given as argument or a
regular expression which _not_ the same
as a known command.

`status`::
Command for showing the current agent status for a given
process. The process id or a regular expression is
required. The launcher will return with 0 when the agent is
running, otherwise with 1.

`list`::
List all local Java processes in a table with the
process id and the description as columns. This is the
default command if no non-option argument is given at
all. `list` returns with 0 upon normal
operation and with 1 otherwise.

`encrypt`::
Encrypt the keystore password. You can add the password to encrypt
as an additional argument or, if not given, it is read from standard input.
The output of this command is the encrypted password in the format `[[....]]`,
which should be used literally (excluding the final newline) for the keystore password
when using the option `keystorePassword` in the agent configuration.

The launcher is especially suited for
_one-shot_, _local_
queries. For example, a simple shell script for printing out
the memory usage of a local Java process, including
(temporarily) attaching an Jolokia agent looks simply like in
the following example. With a complete client library like <ulink
https://www.jmxp4perl.org[Jmx4Perl] even more one
shot scripts are possible footnote:rest-comment[
And in fact, some support for launching this dynamic
agent is planned for a forthcoming release of jmx4perl.].
