[#agents-war]
== Java EE Agent (WAR)

[#war-agent-installation]
=== Installation and Configuration

The WAR agent is the most popular variant, and can be deployed
in a servlet container just like any other Java EE web application.

.Tomcat example
****
A simple example for deploying the agent on Tomcat can be found
in the Jolokia https://www.jolokia.org/tutorial.html[quickstart].
****

Often, installation is simply a matter of copying the agent WAR to
a deployment directory. On other platforms an administrative Web
GUI or a command line tool need to be used for
deployment. Providing detailed installation instructions for every servlet
container is out of scope for this document.

The servlet itself can be configured in two ways:

**Servlet Init Parameters**::
Jolokia can be configured with `init-param`
declarations within the servlet definition in
`WEB-INF/web.xml`. The known parameters are
described in <<agent-war-init-params>>. The
stock agent needs to be repackaged, though, in order to modify
the internal `web.xml`.

**Servlet Context Parameters**::
A more convenient possibility might be to use servlet context
parameters, which can be configured outside the WAR
archive. This is done differently for each servlet container
but involves typically the editing of a configuration
file. E.g. for
https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/context.html[Tomcat],
the context for
the Jolokia agent can be adapted by putting a file
`jolokia.xml` below
`$TC/conf/Catalina/localhost/` with a
content like:
+
[,xml]
----
<Context>
  <Parameter name="maxDepth" value="1"/>
</Context>
----

The configuration options `discoveryEnabled` and
`discoveryAgentUrl` can be provided via environment
variables or system properties, too. See the below for details.

[#agent-war-init-params]
.Servlet init parameters
|===
|Parameter|Description|Example

|`dispatcherClasses`
|Classnames (comma separated) of `RequestDispatcher` used in addition
to the
`LocalRequestDispatcher`. Dispatchers are
a technique used by the JSR-160 proxy to dispatch (or
'route') a request to a different destination. By default no extract dispatchers are enabled (changed in 1.5.0)
You can use the system property `org.jolokia.jsr160ProxyEnabled` or the
environment variable `JOLOKIA_JSR160_PROXY_ENABLED` to enable the the JSR-160 proxy.
In that case you should be sure that you enable authentication for the web application to protect access
to the proxy.
|`org.jolokia.service.jsr160.Jsr160RequestHandler`
(this is the dispatcher for the JSR-160 proxy)

|`jsr160ProxyAllowedTargets`
|Path to a white list of patterns which are matched against possible
JMX service URL for incoming requests.
|`/opt/jolokia/jsr160-proxy-allowed-patterns.txt`

|`policyLocation`
|Location of the policy file to use. This is either a URL
which can read from (like a `file:` or
`http:` URL) or with the special protocol
`classpath:` which is used for looking up
the policy file in the web application's classpath. See
<<security-policy-location>> for details about this
parameter.
|`file:///home/jolokia/jolokia-access.xml`
for a file based access to the policy file. Default is
`classpath:/jolokia-access.xml`

|`restrictorClass`
|Full classname of an implementation of `org.jolokia.restrictor.Restrictor`
which is used as a custom restrictor for securing access via Jolokia.
|`com.mycompany.jolokia.CustomRestrictor` (which must be included in the
war file and must implement `org.jolokia.restrictor.Restrictor`)

|`allowDnsReverseLookup`
|Access can be restricted based on the remote host accessing Jolokia. This host can be
specified as address or an hostname. However, using the hostname normally requires a reverse
DNS lookup which might slow down operations. In order to avoid this reverse DNS lookup
set this property to `false`.
|Default: `true`

|`debug`
|Debugging state after startup. Can be changed via
the config MBean during runtime.
|Default: `false`

|`logHandlerClass`
a|Loghandler to use for providing logging output. By default
logging is written to standard out and error but you can provide
here a Java class implementing `org.jolokia.util.LogHandler`
for an alternative log output. Two alternative implementations are included in
this agent:

* `org.jolokia.util.QuietLogHandler` which switches off
logging completely.
* `org.jolokia.util.JulLogHandler` which uses a `java.util.logging` Logger with name `org.jolokia`
|Example: `org.jolokia.util.LogHandler.Quiet`

|`historyMaxEntries`
|Entries to keep in the history. Can be changed at
runtime via the config MBean.
|Default: `10`

|`debugMaxEntries`
|Maximum number of entries to keep in the local
debug history (if enabled). Can be changed via
the config MBean at runtime.
|Default: `100`

|`maxDepth`
|Maximum depth when traversing bean properties.
If set to 0, depth checking is disabled
|Default: `15`

|`maxCollectionSize`
|Maximum size of collections returned when
serializing to JSON. When set to 0,
collections are never truncated.
|Default: `1000`

|`maxObjects`
|Maximum number of objects which are traversed
when serializing a single response. Use this
as an airbag to avoid boosting your memory and
network traffic. Nevertheless, when set to 0
no limit is imposed.
|Default: `0`

|`mbeanQualifier`
|Qualifier to add to the ObjectName of Jolokia's own
MBeans. This can become necessary if more than one agent is
active within a servlet container. This qualifier is added
to the `ObjectName` of this agent with a
comma. For example a `mbeanQualifier`
with the value `qualifier=own` will
result in Jolokia server handler MBean with the name
`jolokia:type=ServerHandler,qualifier=own`
|

|`mimeType`
|MIME to use for the JSON responses. Only `application/json` and
`text/plain` are allowed.
If any other type is given, Jolokia falls back to `text/plain`.
|Default: `text/plain`

|`canonicalNaming`
|This option specifies in which order the key-value
properties within ObjectNames as returned by
`list` or `search` are
returned. By default this is the so called 'canonical order'
in which the keys are sorted alphabetically. If this option
is set to `false`, then the natural order
is used, i.e. the object name as it was registered. This
option can be overridden with a query parameter of the same
name.
|Default: `true`

|`includeStackTrace`
|Whether to include a stacktrace of an exception in case of
an error. By default it it set to `true`
in which case the stacktrace is always included. If set to
`false`, no stacktrace is included. If
the value is `runtime` a stacktrace is
only included for RuntimeExceptions. This global option can
be overridden with a query parameter.
|Default: `true`

|`serializeException`
|When this parameter is set to `true`,
then an exception thrown will be serialized as JSON and
included in the response under the key
`error_value`. No stacktrace information
will be included, though. This global option can be
overridden by a query parameter of the same name.
|Default: `false`

|`allowErrorDetails`
|If set to `true` then no error details like a stack trace
(when `includeStackTrace` is set) or a serialized exception
(when `serializeExceptin` is set) are included. This can be user as
a startup option to avoid exposure of error details regardless of other options.
|Default: `true`

|`detectorOptions`
|Extra options passed to an detector after successful
detection of an application server. See below for an
explanation.
|

|`discoveryEnabled`
|Is set to `true` then this servlet will
listen for multicast request (multicast-group 239.192.48.84,
port 24884 by default, but can be changed). By default this option is disabled in order to
avoid conflicts with an Java EE standards (though this should't
harm anyways). This option can also be switched on with an
environment variable
`JOLOKIA_DISCOVERY` or the system
property `jolokia.discoveryEnabled` set to
`true`.
|Default: `false`

|`discoveryAgentUrl`
|Sets the URL to respond for multicast discovery requests. If
given, `discoveryEnabled` is set
implicitly to true. This URL can also be provided by an
environment variable
`JOLOKIA_DISCOVERY_AGENT_URL` or the system
property `jolokia.discoveryUrl`. Within the value you can use the
placeholders `$\{host}` and `$\{ip}` which gets replaced
by the autodetected local host name/address. Also with `${env:ENV_VAR}` and
`${sys:property}` environment and system properties can be referenced, respectively.
|`http://10.9.11.87:8080/jolokia`

|`multicastGroup`
|The multicast group IPv4 address. This group IP can be also given as an environment variable `JOLOKIA_MULTICAST_GROUP` or a system property `jolokia.multicastGroup`
|`239.192.48.84`

|`multicastPort`
|The multicast port. This port can be also given as an environment variable `JOLOKIA_MULTICAST_PORT` or a system property `jolokia.multicastPort`
|`24884`

|`agentId`
|A unique ID for this agent. By default a unique id is
calculated. If provided it should be ensured that this id is
unique among all agent reachable via multicast requests used
by the discovery mechanism. It is recommended not to set
this value. Within the `agentId` specification you
can use the same placeholders as in `discoveryAgentUrl`.
|`my-unique-agent-id`

|`agentDescription`
|An optional description which can be used for clients to
present a human readable label for this agent.
|`Monitoring agent`
|===

Jolokia has various detectors which can detect the brand and
version of an application server it is running in. This version
is revealed with the `version` command. With
the configuration parameter `detectorOptions`
extra options can be passed to the detectors. These options take
the form of a JSON object, where the keys are productnames and
the values other JSON objects containing the specific
configuration. This configuration is feed to a successful
detector which can do some extra initialization on agent
startup. Currently the following extra options are supported:

[#agent-war-detector-options]
.Detector Options
|===
|Product|Option|Description

|glassfish
|bootAmx
|If `false` and the agent is running on
GlassFish, this will cause the AMX subsystem not to be booted
during startup. By default, AMX which contains all relevant
MBeans for monitoring GlassFish is booted.
|===

[#agent-war-security]
=== Security Setup

The WAR agent comes in two flavors:

**jolokia.war**::
The standard agent which is secured with the role `jolokia`. You have to setup your servlet container
to connect this role to the authentication.

**jolokia-unsecured.war**::
A demo agent, which is completely unsecured. Please use this agent only for evaluation purposes, but it is
highly recommended that use the security enabled agent `jolokia.war`.

Java EE security is enabled by default by adding the required information within the
`web.xml`.

.Using jmx4perl's `jolokia` tool
****
https://www.jmx4perl.org[jmx4perl] comes
with a nice command line utility called
https://search.cpan.org/~roland/jmx4perl/scripts/jolokia[jolokia]
which allows for an easy setup of security within a given
`jolokia.war`. See <<tools-jmx4perl>> for
more details.
****

All
current client libraries are able to use BASIC HTTP authentication
with user and password. The
`<login-config>` should be set
accordingly. The `<security-constraint>`
specifies the URL pattern (which is in the default setup specify
all resources provided by the Jolokia servlet) and a role name `jolokia`
which is used to find the proper authentication credentials. This
role must be referenced outside the agent WAR within the servlet
container, e.g. for Tomcat the role definition can be found in
`$TOMCAT/config/tomcat-users.xml`.

[#agent-war-programmatic]
=== Programmatic usage of the Jolokia agent servlet

The Jolokia agent servlet can be integrated into one's own
web-applications as well. Simply add a servlet with
the servlet class
`org.jolokia.core.http.AgentServlet` to your
own `web.xml`. The following example maps
the agent to the context `/jolokia`:

[,xml]
----
<servlet>
  <servlet-name>jolokia-agent</servlet-name>
  <servlet-class>org.jolokia.core.http.AgentServlet</servlet-class>
  <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
</servlet>

<servlet-mapping>
  <servlet-name>jolokia-agent</servlet-name>
  <url-pattern>/jolokia/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
----

Of course, any init parameter as described in
<<agent-war-init-params>> can be used here as well.

In order for this servlet definition to find the referenced
Java class, the JAR `jolokia-server-core.jar` must
be included. This jar can be found in
https://labs.consol.de/maven/repository/org/jolokia/jolokia-server-core[Jolokia's maven
resository]. Maven users can declare a
dependency on this jar artifact:

[,xml]
----
<project>
  <!-- ....  -->
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.jolokia</groupId>
      <artifactId>jolokia-server-core</artifactId>
      <version>${jolokia.version}</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  <!-- .... -->
</project>
----

The `org.jolokia.core.http.Agent` can be
subclassed, too in order to provide a custom restrictor or a
custom log handler. See <<security-restrictor>>
for details.footnote:[Replace
`org.jolokia.agent.osgi.http.AgentServlet` with
`org.jolokia.core.http.AgentServlet` to use
the servlet in a non-OSGi environment.]

Also, multiple Jolokia agents can be deployed in the same JVM
without problem. However, since the agent deploys some
Jolokia-specific MBeans on the single
`PlatformMBeansServer`, for multi-agent
deployments it is important to use the
`mbeanQualifier` init parameter to
distinguish multiple Jolokia MBeans by adding an extra
property to those MBeans' names. This also needs to be done if
multiple webapps containing Jolokia agents are deployed on
the same Java EE server.
