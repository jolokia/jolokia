== OSGi Agents

Jolokia agent is also available as
https://www.osgi.org[OSGi,role=externalLink,window=_blank] bundle. The Jolokia 1.x OSGi agent
had two versions (with and without packaged https://github.com/apache/felix-dev/tree/master/http[Felix HTTP Service,role=externalLink,window=_blank] bundles).
In Jolokia 2 there's only one bundle
which requires a https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/8.1.0/service.servlet.html[OSGi CMPN Whiteboard extender,role=externalLink,window=_blank] implementation available in target OSGi runtime.

****
In OSGi world, transition to JakartaEE 9+ (with `jakarta.servlet` packages) is a bit slower. Jolokia 2 has been
tested with dev version of Pax Web 10 using Undertow 2.3, running in dev version of Karaf 4.5.
****

[#agents-osgi-pure]
=== jolokia-agent-osgi.jar

This bundle depends on availability of https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/8.1.0/service.servlet.html[OSGi CMPN Whiteboard extender,role=externalLink,window=_blank] which tracks instances of `jakarta.servlet.Servlet` OSGi services.
Jolokia 2 registers such OSGi servlet service when new `registerWhiteboardServlet` option is set to `true` (which is the default).

All package imports of this bundle are listed in
<<table-agents-osgi-deps>>. Note that the
`pass:[org.osgi.framework.*]` and `pass:[javax.*]`
packages are typically exported
by the system bundle, so no extra installation effort is
required here. Whether the
`pass:[org.osgi.service.*]` interfaces are
available depends on your OSGi container. If they are not
provided, they can be easily fetched and installed from e.g.
https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/osgi/org.osgi.compendium/4.2.0/org.osgi.compendium-4.2.0.jar[maven
central]. Often the `LogService` interface is exported
out of the box, but not the `HttpService`. You will notice any
missing package dependency during the resolve phase while
installing `jolokia-osgi.jar`.

This agent bundle consumes two services by default:

* `org.osgi.service.log.LogService` is used for logging, if available. If such a service is not registered,
the Jolokia bundle uses the standard `HttpServlet.log()` method for its logging needs.
* `org.osgi.service.cm.ConfigurationAdmin` is used to load configuration from `org.jolokia.osgi` PID in OSGi environment
with Configuration Admin service available.

In Jolokia 1, https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/7.0.0/service.http.html[OSGi CMPN HTTP Service,role=externalLink,window=_blank]
was used to register Jolokia servlet. In Jolokia 2 a different pattern is used. Instead of using some service directly by
Jolokia, a servlet is registered as OSGi service which is then processed (_extended_) using https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/8.1.0/service.servlet.html[OSGi CMPN Whiteboard extender,role=externalLink,window=_blank]

The Jolokia OSGi bundle can be configured via the OSGi Configuration Admin
service using the PID `org.jolokia.osgi`
(e.g. if using Apache Karaf, place properties in
`etc/org.jolokia.osgi.cfg` file), or alternatively via global
properties which typically can be configured in a configuration file of
the OSGi container. All properties start with the prefix
`org.jolokia` and are listed in
<<table-agents-osgi-properties>>. They are mostly the
same as the `init-param` options for
a Jolokia servlet when used in a Jakarta EE WAR artifact.

[#table-agents-osgi-properties]
.Jolokia Bundle Properties
[cols="15,~,~"]
|===
|Property|Default|Description

|`org.jolokia.user`
|
|User used for authentication with HTTP Basic Authentication. If not given, no authentication is used.

|`org.jolokia.password`
|
|Password used for authentication with HTTP Basic Authentication.

|`org.jolokia.agentContext`
|`/jolokia`
|Context path of the agent servlet

|`org.jolokia.agentId`
|
|A unique ID for this agent. By default a unique id is
calculated. If provided it should be ensured that this id is
unique among all agent reachable via multicast requests used
by the discovery mechanism. It is recommended not to set
this value. Within the `agentId` specification you
can use the same placeholders as in `discoveryAgentUrl`.

|`org.jolokia.agentDescription`
|
|An optional description which can be used for clients to
present a human readable label for this agent.

|`org.jolokia.debug`
|`false`
|Debugging state after startup. This can be changed via the
Config MBean (`jolokia:type=Config`) at
runtime

|`org.jolokia.debugMaxEntries`
|`100`
|Maximum number of entries to keep in the local debug history
if switched on. This can be changed via the config MBean at
runtime.

|`org.jolokia.maxDepth`
|`0`
|Maximum depth when traversing bean properties.
If set to 0, depth checking is disabled

|`org.jolokia.maxCollectionSize`
|`0`
|Maximum size of collections returned when
serializing to JSON. When set to 0,
collections are not truncated.

|`org.jolokia.maxObjects`
|`0`
|Maximum number of objects which are traversed
when serializing a single response. Use this
as an airbag to avoid boosting your memory and
network traffic. Nevertheless, when set to 0
no limit is imposed.

|`org.jolokia.serializeLong`
|`number`
|How to serialize long values in the JSON response: `number` or `string`.
The default `number` simply serializes longs as numbers in JSON.
If set to `string`, longs are serialized as strings.
It can be useful when a JavaScript client consumes the JSON response,
because numbers greater than the max safe integer don't retain their precision
in JavaScript. +
*Added since Jolokia 2.0.3*

|`org.jolokia.includeRequest`
|`true`
|A flag (defaults to `true`) which controls whether the incoming
request should be included in the response (under `request` key). +
This applies to bulk requests too, so correlation should be done by index
of requests and responses (these are guaranteed to be matching). +
*Added since Jolokia 2.1.0*

|`org.jolokia.dateFormat`
|Default: `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssXXX` (ISO 8601 format)
a|A format specifier to use for formatting dates, calendars and instances of `java.time.Temporal`.
Additionally we can use:

* `unix` to serialize dates as Unix epoch time in seconds
* `time`, `millis`, `long` to serialize dates as Unix epoch time in milliseconds
* `nanos` to serialize dates as Unix epoch time in nanoseconds

*Added since Jolokia 2.1.0*

|`org.jolokia.dateFormatTimeZone`
|Default: local time zone
|A time zone specifier used for date formatters, like `UTC` +
*Added since Jolokia 2.1.0*

|`org.jolokia.historyMaxEntries`
|`10`
|Number of entries to keep in the history. This can be changed at
runtime via the Jolokia config MBean.

|`org.jolokia.registerWhiteboardServlet`
|`true`
|If `true` the bundle registers `org.jolokia.server.core.osgi.OsgiAgentServlet` OSGi service. If `false`, it's your
responsibility to register this servlet in some way.

|`org.jolokia.useRestrictorService`
|`false`
|If `true` the Jolokia agent will use any
`org.jolokia.server.core.service.api.Restrictor`
service for applying access restrictions. If this option is
`false` the standard method of looking up a
security policy file is used, as described in
xref:security.adoc#security-policy[Policy based security].

|`org.jolokia.canonicalNaming`
|`true`
|This option specifies in which order the key-value
properties within ObjectNames as returned by
`list` or `search` are
returned. By default this is the so called _canonical order_
in which the keys are sorted alphabetically. If this option
is set to `false`, then the natural order
is used, i.e. the object name as it was registered. This
option can be overridden with a query parameter of the same
name.

|`org.jolokia.includeStackTrace`
|`false`
|Whether to include a stacktrace of an exception in case of
an error. By default it it set to `false`
in which case the stacktrace is never included. If
the value is `runtime` a stacktrace is
only included for RuntimeExceptions. This global option can
be overridden with a query parameter.

|`org.jolokia.serializeException`
|`false`
|When this parameter is set to `true`,
then an exception thrown will be serialized as JSON and
included in the response under the key
`error_value`. No stacktrace information
will be included, though. This global option can be
overridden by a query parameter of the same name.

|`org.jolokia.detectorOptions`
|
|An optional JSON representation for application specific
options used by detectors for post-initialization steps. See the description of
`detectorOptions` in
xref:agents/war.adoc#agent-war-init-params[Servlet init parameters] for details.

|`org.jolokia.enabledServices`
|
|A comma-separated list of fully-qualified class names. If this configuration option is specified and is not empty, only the services from this list will be actually used.

|`org.jolokia.disabledServices`
|
|A comma-separated list of fully-qualified class names. If this configuration option is specified and is not empty, all detected services (from `/META-INF/jolokia/services(-default)`) will be filtered to not include the disabled services.

|`org.jolokia.disableDetectors`
|false
|A flag that disables usage of `org.jolokia.server.core.detector.ServerDetector` services alltogether.

|`org.jolokia.discoveryEnabled`
|`false`
|If set to `true` then this servlet will
listen for multicast request (multicast-group `239.192.48.84`,
port `24884` by default, but can be configured).
By default this option is disabled in order to
avoid conflicts with an Jakarta EE standards (though this shouldn't
harm anyways). This option can also be switched on with an
environment variable
`JOLOKIA_DISCOVERY_ENABLED` or the system
property `jolokia.discoveryEnabled` set to
`true`.

|`org.jolokia.discoveryAgentUrl`
|
|Sets the URL to respond for multicast discovery requests. If
given, `discoveryEnabled` is set
implicitly to true. This URL can also be provided by an
environment variable
`JOLOKIA_DISCOVERY_AGENT_URL` or the system
property `jolokia.discoveryUrl`. Within the value you can use the
placeholders `$\{host}` and `$\{ip}` which gets replaced
by the autodetected local host name/address. Also with `$\{env:ENV_VAR}` and
`$\{sys:property}` environment and system properties can be referenced, respectively.

|`org.jolokia.multicastGroup`
|`239.192.48.84`
|The multicast group IPv4 address. This group IP can be also given as an environment variable `JOLOKIA_MULTICAST_GROUP` or a system property `jolokia.multicastGroup`. The default is IPv4 address but IPv6 can also be used, for example `[ff08::48:84]`.

|`org.jolokia.multicastPort`
|`24884`
|The multicast port. This port can be also given as an environment variable `JOLOKIA_MULTICAST_PORT` or a system property `jolokia.multicastPort`

|`org.jolokia.realm`
|`jolokia`
|Sets the security realm to use. If the `authMode` is set to
`jaas` this is also used as value for the security domain.
E.g. for Karaf 3 and later, this realm should be `karaf` since
all JMX MBeans are guarded by this security domain.

|`org.jolokia.authMode`
|`basic`
|Can be either `basic` (the default), `jaas`,
`service-all` or `service-any`. If
`jaas` is used, the user and password which are given in the `Authorization:`
header are used for login in via JAAS and, if successful, the return subject is used for all Jolokia operation.
When no user is set and the `authMode` is either `service-all` or
`service-any` then a `org.jolokia.osgi.security.Authenticator` service is looked up in the
OSGi service registry. If more then one of such service is registered, `service-all` requires
that all authenticators succeed, for `service-any` it is sufficient that one authenticator
successfully authenticates. In any case if no such Authenticator service can be found, the request is rejected.
|===

This bundle also exports the service
`jakarta.servlet.ServletContext`
which can be used to obtain context information of the
registered agent like the context path under which this
servlet can be reached. Additionally, it exports
`org.osgi.service.servlet.context.ServletContextHelper`, which
is used for authentication. Note that this service is only
available when the agent servlet is active (i.e. when an
whiteboard servlet is registered).

[#agents-osgi-servlet]
=== Programmatic servlet registration

It is also possible to register the Jolokia agent servlet
manually instead of relying of the OSGi bundle activator which
comes with the OSGi agent.
`jolokia-agent-osgi.jar` bundle exports the package
`org.jolokia.server.core.osgi` which includes
the servlet class `org.jolokia.server.core.osgi.OsgiAgentServlet`. This
class has three constructors: A default constructor without
arguments, one with a single
`BundleContext` argument and finally one
with an additional `org.jolokia.server.core.service.api.Restrictor` (see
xref:security.adoc#security-restrictor[Jolokia Restrictors] for details how access
restrictions can be applied).
The constructor with a
`BundleContext` as its argument has the
advantage that it will use an OSGi
`LogService` if available and adds various
OSGi server detectors which adds server information like product
name and version to the `version`
command. Refer to xref:protocol/version.adoc#version[Getting the agent version] for details about the server information provided.

Please note that for this use case the bundle
`org.jolokia.agent.osgi` should not be
_started_ but left in the state
_resolved_. Otherwise, as soon as an OSGi
HttpService registers, this bundle will try to add yet another
agent servlet to this service, which is probably not what you
want. Alternatively, the bundle property
`org.jolokia.registerWhiteboardServlet` can be set
to `false` in which case there will be never an
automatic servlet registration.

=== Restrictor service

As described in xref:security.adoc#security-restrictor[Jolokia Restrictors], the
Jolokia agent can use custom restrictors implementing the
interface
`org.jolokia.server.core.service.api.Restrictor`. If the
bundle property
`org.jolokia.useRestrictorService` is set to
`true` and no restrictor is configured by other means, the agent
will use one or more OSGi service with
`org.jolokia.server.core.service.api.Restrictor` interface. If no
such service is available, access to the agent is always
denied. If one such restrictor service is available, the access
decision is delegated to this service. When more than one
restrictor service is available, access is only granted if all of
them individually grant access. A sample restrictor service as a
maven project can be found in the Jolokia source at
`examples/osgi-restrictor`.

Here's an example where this custom restrictor is installed and configured (because by default `org.jolokia.useRestrictorService` is set to `false`):

[,subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
karaf@root()> install -s mvn:org.jolokia/jolokia-example-osgi-restrictor/{jolokia-version}
Register sample restrictor service
Bundle ID: 68

karaf@root()> config:property-set --pid org.jolokia.osgi org.jolokia.useRestrictorService true

karaf@root()> restart org.jolokia.agent.osgi
----

Then we can only access MBeans from `java.lang` domain:

----
$ curl -s http://localhost:8181/jolokia/read/java.lang:type=Runtime/Name | jq .
{
  "request": {
    "mbean": "java.lang:type=Runtime",
    "attribute": "Name",
    "type": "read"
  },
  "value": "94143@everfree.forest",
  "status": 200,
  "timestamp": 1702305458
}

$ curl -s http://localhost:8181/jolokia/read/java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=direct/Count | jq .
{
  "request": {
    "mbean": "java.nio:name=direct,type=BufferPool",
    "attribute": "Count",
    "type": "read"
  },
  "error_type": "java.lang.Exception",
  "error": "java.lang.Exception : Reading attribute Count is forbidden for MBean java.nio:name=direct,type=BufferPool",
  "status": 403
}
----
