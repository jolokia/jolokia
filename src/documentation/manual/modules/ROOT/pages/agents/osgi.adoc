== OSGi Agents

****
There are several free implementations available of OSGi
`HttpService`. This bundle has been tested with the
https://wiki.ops4j.org/display/paxweb/Pax+Web[Pax Web]
and
https://felix.apache.org/site/apache-felix-http-service.html[Apache
Felix] `HttpService`, both of which come with an embedded Jetty
as servlet container by default.
****

Jolokia agents are also available as
https://www.osgi.org[OSGi] bundles. There are two
flavors of this agent: A nearly bare agent
`jolokia-osgi.jar` declaring all its package
dependencies as imports in its Manifest and an all-in-one bundle
`jolokia-osgi-bundle.jar` with minimal
dependencies. The pure bundle fits best with the OSGi philosophy and is
hence the recommended bundle. The all-in-one monster is good for a
quick start since normally no additional bundles are required.

[#agents-osgi-pure]
=== jolokia-osgi.jar

This bundle depends mostly on a running
https://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v42/org/osgi/service/http/HttpService.html[OSGi
HttpService] which it uses for registering the agent
servlet.

All package imports of this bundle are listed in
<<table-agents-osgi-deps>>. Note that the
`pass:[org.osgi.framework.*]` and `pass:[javax.*]`
packages are typically exported
by the system bundle, so no extra installation effort is
required here. Whether the
`pass:[org.osgi.service.*]` interfaces are
available depends on your OSGi container. If they are not
provided, they can be easily fetched and installed from e.g.
https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/osgi/org.osgi.compendium/4.2.0/org.osgi.compendium-4.2.0.jar[maven
central]. Often the `LogService` interface is exported
out of the box, but not the `HttpService`. You will notice any
missing package dependency during the resolve phase while
installing `jolokia-osgi.jar`.

This agent bundle consumes two services by default: As stated
above, an
`org.osgi.service.http.HttpService` which
is used to register (deregister) the Jolokia agent as a servlet
under the context `/jolokia` by default as soon
as the `HttpService` becomes available (unavailable). Secondly, an
`org.osgi.service.log.LogService` is used
for logging, if available. If such a service is not registered,
the Jolokia bundle uses the standard
`HttpServlet.log()` method for its
logging needs.

The Jolokia OSGi bundle can be configured via the OSGi Configuration Admin
service using the PID `org.jolokia.osgi`
(e.g. if using Apache Karaf, place properties in
`etc/org.jolokia.osgi.cfg`), or alternatively via global
properties which typically can be configured in a configuration file of
the OSGi container. All properties start with the prefix
`org.jolokia` and are listed in
<<table-agents-osgi-properties>>. They are mostly the
same as the `init-param` options for
a Jolokia servlet when used in a Java EE WAR artifact.

[#table-agents-osgi-properties]
.Jolokia Bundle Properties
|===
|Property|Default|Description

|`org.jolokia.user`
|
|User used for authentication with HTTP Basic
Authentication. If not given, no authentication is used.

|`org.jolokia.password`
|
|Password used for authentication with HTTP Basic
Authentication.

|`org.jolokia.agentContext`
|`/jolokia`
|Context path of the agent servlet

|`org.jolokia.agentId`
|
|A unique ID for this agent. By default a unique id is
calculated. If provided it should be ensured that this id is
unique among all agent reachable via multicast requests used
by the discovery mechanism. It is recommended not to set
this value. Within the `agentId` specification you
can use the same placeholders as in `discoveryAgentUrl`.

|`org.jolokia.agentDescription`
|
|An optional description which can be used for clients to
present a human readable label for this agent.

|`org.jolokia.dispatcherClasses`
|
|Class names (comma separated) of request dispatchers used in
addition to the LocalRequestDispatcher. E.g using a value
of
`org.jolokia.service.jsr160.Jsr160RequestHandler`
allows the agent to play the role of a JSR-160 proxy.
By default no extract dispatchers are enabled.
You can use the system property `org.jolokia.jsr160ProxyEnabled` or the
environment variable `JOLOKIA_JSR160_PROXY_ENABLED` to enable the the JSR-160 proxy.
In that case you should be sure that you enable authentication for the web application to protect access
to the proxy.

|`org.jolokia.debug`
|`false`
|Debugging state after startup. This can be changed via the
Config MBean (`jolokia:type=Config`) at
runtime

|`org.jolokia.debugMaxEntries`
|`100`
|Maximum number of entries to keep in the local debug history
if switched on. This can be changed via the config MBean at
runtime.

|`org.jolokia.maxDepth`
|`0`
|Maximum depth when traversing bean properties.
If set to 0, depth checking is disabled

|`org.jolokia.maxCollectionSize`
|`0`
|Maximum size of collections returned when
serializing to JSON. When set to 0,
collections are not truncated.

|`org.jolokia.maxObjects`
|`0`
|Maximum number of objects which are traversed
when serializing a single response. Use this
as an airbag to avoid boosting your memory and
network traffic. Nevertheless, when set to 0
no limit is imposed.

|`org.jolokia.historyMaxEntries`
|`10`
|Number of entries to keep in the history. This can be changed at
runtime via the Jolokia config MBean.

|`org.jolokia.listenForHttpService`
|`true`
|If `true` the bundle listens for an OSGi
`HttpService` and if available registers an
agent servlet to it.

|`org.jolokia.httpServiceFilter`
|
|Can be any valid OSGi filter for locating a which
`org.osgi.service.http.HttpService`
is used to expose the Jolokia servlet. The syntax is that
used by the `org.osgi.framework.Filter`
which is in turn a https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1960.txt[RFC 1960 based filter]. The use of this property
is described in <<running-on-glassfish>>

|`org.jolokia.useRestrictorService`
|`false`
|If `true` the Jolokia agent will use any
`org.jolokia.core.service.Restrictor`
service for applying access restrictions. If this option is
`false` the standard method of looking up a
security policy file is used, as described in
<<security-policy>>.

|`org.jolokia.canonicalNaming`
|`true`
|This option specifies in which order the key-value
properties within ObjectNames as returned by
`list` or `search` are
returned. By default this is the so called _canonical order_
in which the keys are sorted alphabetically. If this option
is set to `false`, then the natural order
is used, i.e. the object name as it was registered. This
option can be overridden with a query parameter of the same
name.

|`org.jolokia.includeStackTrace`
|`true`
|Whether to include a stacktrace of an exception in case of
an error. By default it it set to `true`
in which case the stacktrace is always included. If set to
`false`, no stacktrace is included. If
the value is `runtime` a stacktrace is
only included for RuntimeExceptions. This global option can
be overridden with a query parameter.

|`org.jolokia.serializeException`
|`false`
|When this parameter is set to `true`,
then an exception thrown will be serialized as JSON and
included in the response under the key
`error_value`. No stacktrace information
will be included, though. This global option can be
overridden by a query parameter of the same name.

|`org.jolokia.detectorOptions`
|
|An optional JSON representation for application specific
options used by detectors for post-initialization steps. See the description of
`detectorOptions` in
<<agent-war-init-params>> for details.

|`org.jolokia.discoveryEnabled`
|`false`
|Is set to `true` then this servlet will
listen for multicast request (multicast-group `239.192.48.84`,
port `24884` by default, but can be configured).
By default this option is disabled in order to
avoid conflicts with an Java EE standards (though this should't
harm anyways). This option can also be switched on with an
environment variable
`JOLOKIA_DISCOVERY` or the system
property `jolokia.discoveryEnabled` set to
`true`.

|`org.jolokia.discoveryAgentUrl`
|
|Sets the URL to respond for multicast discovery requests. If
given, `discoveryEnabled` is set
implicitly to true. This URL can also be provided by an
environment variable
`JOLOKIA_DISCOVERY_AGENT_URL` or the system
property `jolokia.discoveryUrl`. Within the value you can use the
placeholders `$\{host}` and `$\{ip}` which gets replaced
by the autodetected local host name/address. Also with `$\{env:ENV_VAR}` and
`$\{sys:property}` environment and system properties can be referenced, respectively.

|`org.jolokia.multicastGroup`
|`239.192.48.84`
|The multicast group IPv4 address. This group IP can be also given as an environment variable `JOLOKIA_MULTICAST_GROUP` or a system property `jolokia.multicastGroup`

|`org.jolokia.multicastPort`
|`24884`
|The multicast port. This port can be also given as an environment variable `JOLOKIA_MULTICAST_PORT` or a system property `jolokia.multicastPort`

|`org.jolokia.realm`
|`jolokia`
|Sets the security realm to use. If the `authMode` is set to
`jaas` this is also used as value for the security domain.
E.g. for Karaf 3 and later, this realm should be `karaf` since
all JMX MBeans are guarded by this security domain.

|`org.jolokia.authMode`
|`basic`
|Can be either `basic` (the default), `jaas`,
`service-all` or `service-any`. If
`jaas` is used, the user and password which are given in the `Authorization:`
header are used for login in via JAAS and, if successful, the return subject is used for all Jolokia operation.
When no user is set and the `authMode` is either `service-all` or
`service-any` then a `org.jolokia.osgi.security.Authenticator` service is looked up in the
OSGi service registry. If more then one of such service is registered, `service-all` requires
that all authenticators succeed, for `service-any` it is sufficient that one authenticator
successfully authenticates. In any case if no such Authenticator service can be found, the request is rejected.
|===

This bundle also exports the service
`org.jolokia.server.core.osgi.servlet.JolokiaContext`
which can be used to obtain context information of the
registered agent like the context path under which this
servlet can be reached. Additionally, it exports
`org.osgi.service.http.HttpContext`, which
is used for authentication. Note that this service is only
available when the agent servlet is active (i.e. when an
`HttpService` is registered).

[#running-on-glassfish]
=== Running on GlassFish v3 upwards

You have a couple of choices when running Jolokia on
GlassFish v3 and up, since GlassFish is a both a fully
fledged Java EE container and an OSGi container. If you
choose to run the xref:agents/war.adoc[Java EE Agent (WAR)] then it
is completely straight forward just deploy the war
in the normal way. If you choose to deploy
the xref:agents/osgi.adoc[OSGi Agents] then you will need
to configure the `org.jolokia.httpServiceFilter`
option with a filter to select either the Admin
`HttpService` (`4848` by default) or the Default
`HttpService` which is where WAR files are
deployed to.

In GlassFish 3.1.2 the OSGi bundle configuration is done in
`glassfish/conf/osgi.properties` in version's
prior to this the configuration is by default in
`glassfish/osgi/felix/conf/config.properties`
or if you are using Equinox
`glassfish/osgi/equinox/configuration/config.ini`

----
# Restrict the jolokia http service selection to the admin host
org.jolokia.httpServiceFilter=(VirtualServer=__asadmin)
# Or alternatively to the normal http service use : (VirtualServer=server)
----

Deploying the bundle can be either be done by coping the
`jolokia-osgi.jar` into the domain
`glassfish/domains/<domain>/autodeploy/bundles`
directory or it can be added to all instances by copying the jar
to `glassfish/modules/autostart`

By default the agent will be available on `http://localhost:<port>/osgi/jolokia`
rather than `http://localhost:<port>/jolokia` as with WAR deployment.

[#agents-osgi-bundle]
=== jolokia-osgi-bundle.jar

The all-in-one bundle includes an implementation of
`org.osgi.service.http.HttpService`,
i.e. the
https://felix.apache.org/site/apache-felix-http-service.html[Felix
implementation]. The `HttpService` will be registered as
OSGi service during startup, so it is available for other
bundles as well. The only package import requirement for this
bundle is `org.osgi.service.LogService`,
since the Felix Webservice requires this during startup. As
mentioned above, normally the `LogService` interface gets exported
by default in the standard containers, but if not, you need to
install it e.g. from the OSGi
https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/osgi/org.osgi.compendium/4.2.0/org.osgi.compendium-4.2.0.jar[compendium]
definitions.

This bundle can be configured the same way as the pure bundle as
described in <<agents-osgi-pure>>. Additionally,
the embedded Felix HttpService can be configured as described in
its
https://felix.apache.org/site/apache-felix-http-service.html#ApacheFelixHTTPService-ConfigurationProperties[documentation].
e.g. setting the port to 9090 instead of the default port 8080, a property
`org.osgi.service.http.port=9090` needs to be
set. This might be useful, if this bundle is used within
containers which already occupy the default port (GlassFish,
Eclipse Virgo) but don't expose an OSGi HttpService.

[#agents-osgi-servlet]
=== Programmatic servlet registration

It is also possible to register the Jolokia agent servlet
manually instead of relying of the OSGi bundle activator which
comes with the agents. For this use case
`jolokia-osgi.jar` should be used. This
bundle exports the package
`org.jolokia.server.core.osgi.servlet` which includes
the servlet class `JolokiaServlet`. This
class has three constructors: A default constructor without
arguments, one with a single
`BundleContext` argument and finally one
with an additional `Restrictor` (see
<<security-restrictor>> for details how access
restrictions can be applied). The constructor with a
`BundleContext` as its argument has the
advantage that it will use an OSGi
`LogService` if available and adds various
OSGi server detectors which adds server information like product
name and version to the `version`
command. Refer to <<version>> for details about the
server infos provided.

Please note that for this use case the bundle
`org.jolokia.agent.osgi` should not be
_started_ but left in the state
_resolved_. Otherwise, as soon as an OSGi
HttpService registers, this bundle will try to add yet another
agent servlet to this service, which is probably not what you
want. Alternatively, the bundle property
`org.jolokia.listenForHttpService` can be set
to `false` in which case there will be never an
automatic servlet registration to an HttpService.

=== Restrictor service

As described in <<security-restrictor>>, the
Jolokia agent can use custom restrictors implementing the
interface
`org.jolokia.core.service.Restrictor`. If the
bundle property
`org.jolokia.useRestrictorService` is set to
true and no restrictor is configured by other means, the agent
will use one or more OSGi service which register under the name
`org.jolokia.core.service.Restrictor`. If no
such service is available, access to the agent is always
denied. If one such restrictor service is available, the access
decision is delegated to this service. When more than one
restrictor service is available, access is only granted if all of
them individually grant access. A sample restrictor service as a
maven project can be found in the Jolokia source at
`agent/osgi/restrictor-sample`.
