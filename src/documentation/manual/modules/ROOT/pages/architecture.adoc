= Architecture

The architecture of Jolokia is quite different to that of JSR-160
connectors. One of the most striking difference is Jolokia's
typeless approach.

JSR-160, released in 2003, has a different design goal than
Jolokia. It is a specification with which a client can transparently
invoke MBean calls, regardless whether the MBean resides within a
local or remote MBeanServer. This provides a good deal of
comfort for Java clients of this API, but it is also dangerous
_because_ it hides the remoteness of JMX
calls. There are several subtle issues, performance
being one of them. It _does_ matter whether a
call is invoked locally or remotely. A caller should at least be
aware what happens and what the consequences are. On the other
side, there are message passing models which include remoting
explicitly, so that the caller _knows_ from
the programming model that she is calling a potentially expensive
remote call. This is probably the main reason why RMI (the default
protocol stack of JSR-160 connectors) lost market share to
more explicit remote protocols.

One problem with JSR-160 is it implicit reliance on RMI and its
requirement for a complete (Java) object serialization mechanism
for passing management information over the wire. This closes the
door for all environments which are not Java (or more precisely, JVM)
aware. Jolokia uses a typeless approach, where some sort of
lightweight serialization to JSON is used (in both directions, but
a bit _asymmetrically_ in its capabilities). Of course
this approach has some drawbacks, too, but also quite some
advantages. At least it is unique in the JMX world ;-).

[#agent-mode]
== Agent mode

<<fig-architecture-overview>> illustrates the
environment in which Jolokia operates. The agent exports on the
frontside a JSON based protocol over HTTP that gets bridged to
invocation of local JMX MBeans. It lives outside the JSR-160
space and hence requires a different setup. Various techniques
are available for exporting its protocol via HTTP. The most
prominent being to put the agent into a servlet container. This
can be a lightweight one like Tomcat or Jetty or a full-blown
Java EE Server. Since it acts like a usual web application the
deployment of the agent is well understood and should pose no
entry barrier for any developer who has ever dealt with Java web
applications.

But there are more options. Specialized agents are able to use an OSGi
HttpService. The JVM agent uses the HTTP-Server included
with every Oracle JVM 6 and can be attached dynamically to any
running Java process. Agents are described in detail in
xref:agents.adoc[].

Jolokia can be also integrated
into one's own applications very easily. The `jolokia-core`
library (which comes bundled as a jar), includes a servlet
which can be easily added to a custom application.
xref:agents.adoc#agent-war-programmatic[Programmatic usage of the Jolokia agent servlet] contains more information
about this.

[#proxy-mode]
== Proxy Mode

Proxy mode is a solution for when it is impossible to deploy
the Jolokia agent on the target platform. For this mode, the
only prerequisite for accessing the target server is a JSR-160
connection. Most of the time this happens for political reasons,
where it is simply not allowed to deploy an extra piece of
software or where doing so requires a lengthy approval process.
Another reason could be that the target server already
exports JMX via JSR-160 and you want to avoid the extra step of
deploying the agent.

A dedicated proxy servlet server is needed for hosting
`jolokia.war`, which by default supports both
the _agent mode_ and the _proxy
mode_. A lightweight container like Tomcat or Jetty is
a perfect choice for this kind of setup.

Figure <<fig-architecture-proxy>> describes a typical setup for the proxy mode. A
client sends a usual Jolokia request containing an extra section
for specifying the target which should be queried. All routing
information is contained in the request itself so that the proxy
can act universally without the need of a specific
configuration.

Having said all that, the proxy mode has some limitations which are
listed in xref:proxy_mode.adoc[].

To summarize, the proxy mode should be used only when
required. The agent servlet on its own is more powerful than the
proxy mode since it eliminates an additional layer adding to the
overall complexity and performance. Also, some features like
merging of MBeanServers are not available in the proxy mode.
