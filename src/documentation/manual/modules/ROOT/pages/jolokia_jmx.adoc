[#jmx]
= Jolokia JMX

The main focus of Jolokia is to allow easy access to JMX MBeans
from everywhere. MBeans can be provided by the JVM itself, by an
application server or an application itself, where each MBean is
registered at a specific MBeanServer.  Multiple MBeanServers can
co-exist in a single JVM. The so called
_PlatformMBeanServer_ is always present and is
created by the JVM during startup. Especially application servers
often create additional MBeanServers for various purposes. When
accessing an MBean remotely via JSR-160, the MBeanServer holding
the requested MBean must be known before. Jolokia instead
_merges_ all MBeanServers it can find to give a
single view on all MBeans. The merging algorithm is described in
<<mbeanserver-merging>>.

For application specific MBeans, Jolokia provides an own, so
called _Jolokia MBeanServer_ which is treated
specially by the Jolokia agent. The Jolokia MBeanServer and its
features are explained in <<jolokia-mbeanserver>>.

Developing application specific MBeans is easy, especially if
sttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jmx/mbeans/standard.html[Standard
MBeans] are used. However, for Spring users there is even a
easier, more
https://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.2.1.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/html/jmx.html[declarative
way] for turning POJOs into MBeans. On top of this Jolokia
provides an easy, declarative way for firing up a Jolokia JVM
agent merely by including some Jolokia specific Spring
configuration. This is described in <<jvm-spring>>.

[#jolokia-mbeanserver]
== Jolokia MBeanServer

.JBoss 7 Gotcha
****
For JBoss 7 there is a slight issue when creating a new `MBeanServer`. For this to work,
a `jboss-deployment-structure` with a dependency on
`org.jboss.as.jmx` must be added. For an example see the
https://github.com/rhuss/jolokia/blob/master/it/war/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/jboss-deployment-structure.xml[integration test war], the location
to where to put this file is explained in the https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS7/Developer+Guide#DeveloperGuide-JBossDeploymentStructureFile[JBoss documentation].
****

The Jolokia MBeanServer can be easily created and used with a locator:

[,java]
----
MBeanServer jolokiaServer = JolokiaMBeanServerUtil.getJolokiaMBeanServer();
----

This server is treated specially by a Jolokia Agent:

* Every MBean registered at the Jolokia MBeanServer will never
show up remotely via JSR-160. The Jolokia MBeanServer is never
exposed over JSR-160.
* Each Jolokia MBeanServer registered MBean will shadow any
MBean with the same ObjectName in any other MBeanServer
present. See below for more details.
* The Jolokia MBeanServer is also responsible for managing so
called _JSON MBeans_. These are MBeans
annotated with `@JsonMBean` on the class
level. JSON MBean are explained in
<<json-mbean>>

[#mbeanserver-merging]
=== MBeanServer merging

Jolokia tries hard to detect as many MBeanServer as available
in a JVM. Beside the always present
`PlatformMBeanServer` many
application servers create own MBeanServer which not always
can be found with standard mechanisms. Therefore Jolokia comes
with so called ``ServerDetector``'s for many
known brands of applications server. These server detectors
know how to find MBeanServer by application server specific
means.

The set of available of MBeanServers is detected during
startup and kept, except for the Jolokia MBeanServer which can
kick in and out at any time. For Jolokia operations, all these
MBeanServers are tried according the order given below.

* *Jolokia `MBeanServer`* is queried first,
if available.
* Next every `MBeanServer` as detected by the _server
detectors_ a queried in turn.
* All MBeanServers returned by
`MBeanServerFactory.findMBeanServer(null)` are
called if not already tried previously.
* Finally, the
`ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer()` is
used (also, if not found in a former step).

All MBeans contained in all detected MBeanServers are merged
to give a single view on the set of available MBeans.
For MBeans registered with the same name at different
MBeanServers, MBeans registered in later MBeanServers are not
visible. These hidden MBeans will never be called on
`READ`, `WRITE` or
`EXEC` operations. Also, for
`LIST` operations only the meta data of the
visible MBeans is returned.

This hiding mechanism is used by
`@JsonMBean` to provide a different view of
an MBean for JSR-160 connectors (see below).

[#json-mbean]
== @JsonMBean

JMX 1.4 introduced <ulink
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/management/MXBean.html[MXBeans]
which allows for nearly arbitrary data to be translated into so
called OpenData which are accessible via JMX. For example,
arbitrary Java Beans are translated into a
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/management/openmbean/CompositeData.html[`CompositeData`]
structure with property names as keys and their values in
OpenData values.

Jolokia provides an annotation `@JsonMBean`
for marking an MBean as a JSON MBean. Such an MBean, if
registered at the _Jolokia MBeanServer_
creates a proxy on the _PlatformMBeanServer_
where every complex value gets translated into plain strings in
JSON format. This is true for attributes, operation return
values and arguments. That way, a JSR-160 based console (like
`jconsole`) can easily access complex data
type exposed by custom MBeans. Json MBeans work for Java 6 and
newer.

[#fig-jconsole-json-mbean]
.A JsonMBean in jconsole
image::jconsole-json-mbean.png[]

JsonMBean and MXBean are quite similar as both do a translation
from complex data types to a standard format (OpenType for
MXBeans, JSON strings for JsonMBean). However, there are also
differences:

* MXBeans are a standard mechanism which are available on every
JVM since 1.5.footnote:jboss-mxbean[
For JBoss prior to version 7 there are some slight issues
since JBoss used to replace the standard MBeanServer with an
own variant. See this
https://community.jboss.org/thread/167796[discussion]
for details.]
* Serialization of complex Java Beans is more powerful with
JsonMBeans, e.g. Jolokia can detect self (or cyclic) object
references. MXBeans will cause an error in this case.
* JsonMBeans must be added to the Jolokia MBeanServer to
work. MXBeans work with the PlatformMBeanServer, too.
* JsonMBean work also with JMX support libraries which use
``ModelMBean``'s under the hood. E.g.
https://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/reference/jmx.html[Spring
JMX] uses a ModelMBean for
`@ManagedResource` annotated
MBeans. `@JsonMBean` can be easily added,
whereas `@MXBean` wouldn't work here.

The Jolokia MBeanServer and the
`@JsonMBean` annotation are contained in the
Maven module `jolokia-jmx`.

[#jvm-spring]
== Spring Support

A Jolokia agent can be easily integrated into a Spring application
context. A dedicated artifact
`jolokia-spring` can be used, which
comes with a custom Spring configuration syntax.

For Maven based projects, a simple dependency declaration is
sufficient:

[,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.jolokia</groupId>
  <artifactId>jolokia-spring</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
----

[#jvm-spring-agent]
=== JVM agent

With this in place, the following configuration can be used to
fire up a Jolokia JVM based agent using the HTTP server which
comes with OpenJDK/Oracle JVMs (Version 6 or later).

[,xml]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:jolokia="http://www.jolokia.org/jolokia-spring/schema/config"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
           http://www.jolokia.org/jolokia-spring/schema/config
           http://www.jolokia.org/jolokia-spring/schema/config/jolokia-config.xsd">

  <jolokia:agent lookupConfig="false" systemPropertiesMode="never">
    <jolokia:config autoStart="true" host="0.0.0.0" port="8778" .... />
  </jolokia:agent>
</beans>
----

There are two directives available:
`<jolokia:agent>` declares a Jolokia
server with a configuration as defined in an embedded
`<jolokia:config>` configuration
section.

.IDE support
****
With a decent IDE like IntelliJ IDEA you get completion support
on the configuration attributes so it can be easily determined
which configuration options are available. Even better, there is also
some documentation for each attribute (e.g. by using "Quick
documentation" with ^Q in IDEA with).
****

`<jolokia:agent>` has an attribute
`lookupConfig`. If set to
`true`, externally defined
`<jolokia:config>` sections will be
looked up, too and merged with the embedded configuration. A
`<jolokia:config>` has an
`order` attribute, which determines the
config merge order: The higher order configs will be merged
later and hence will override conflicting parameters. By
default, external config lookup is disabled.

The attribute `systemPropertiesMode`
determines, how system properties with a  prefix
`jolokia.` can be used as configuration
values. There are three modes available:

[#jvm-spring-system-properties]
.System properties modes
|===
|Mode|Description

<tr>
|`never`
|No lookup is done on system properties as all. This is the
default mode.


|`fallback`
|System properties with a prefix
`jolokia.` are used as fallback
configuration values if not specified locally in the
Spring application
context. E.g. `jolokia.port=8888` will
change the port on which the agent is listening to 8888 if
the port is not explicitly specified in the
configuration.

|`override`
|System properties with a prefix
`jolokia.` are used as configuration
values even if they are specified locally in the Spring
application
context. E.g. `jolokia.port=8888` will
change the port on which the agent is listening to 8888 in
any case.

|===

`<jolokia:config>` takes as attributes all
the configuration parameters for the JVM agent as described in
<<agent-jvm-config>>. In addition, the is an extra
attribute `autoStart` which allows for
automatically starting the HTTP server during the initialization
of the application context. By default this is set to
`true`, so the server starts up automatically
by default.

Just in case you don't want to use the Jolokia Spring namespace you can also
use plain beans to configure a JVM agent. The following examples shows the example above with
only base Spring bean configurations (including an Spring EL expression):

[,xml]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
       xmlns:util="http://www.springframework.org/schema/util"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/util
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/util/spring-util.xsd">

  <bean name="server" id="jolokia" class="org.jolokia.jvmagent.spring.SpringJolokiaAgent">
    <property name="lookupConfig" value="false"/>
    <property name="systemPropertiesMode" value="never"/>
    <property name="config">
      <bean class="org.jolokia.jvmagent.spring.SpringJolokiaConfigHolder">
        <property name="config">
          <util:map>
            <entry key="autoStart" value="true"/>
            <entry key="host" value="0.0.0.0"/>
            <entry key="port" value="#{configuration['jmx.jolokiaPort']}"/>
            ...
          </util:map>
        </property>
      </bean>
    </property>
  </bean>

</beans>
----

This style however is only recommended if there are some issues with the Jolokia spring configuration setup
(like using Spring EL expressions in Jolokia versions earlier than 1.2.4). Otherwise, the Jolokia configuration
namespace is much easier to read.

[#jvm-spring-mbean-server]
=== Jolokia MBeanServer

With `<jolokia:mbean-server>` the Jolokia
MBeanServer can be specified. This is especially useful for
adding it to `<context:mbean-export>`
so that this MBeanServer is used for registering
`@ManagedResource` and
`@JsonMBean`. Remember, MBean registered at
the Jolokia MBeanServer never will show up in an JSR-160 client
except when annotated with `@JsonMBean`.

[,xml]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
       xmlns:jolokia="http://www.jolokia.org/jolokia-spring/schema/config"
       xsi:schemaLocation="

  <context:mbean-export server="jolokiaServer"/>
  <jolokia:mbean-server id="jolokiaServer"/>

</beans>
----

[#jvm-spring-plugin]
=== Jolokia Spring plugin

There is an even simpler way to startup a Jolokia JVM agent
with a default setup if you use a variant of the
`jolokia-spring` module with the classifier
`plugin`. This artifact contains a
predefined Spring configuration for starting up Jolokia with
default values automatically:

[,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.jolokia</groupId>
  <artifactId>jolokia-spring</artifactId>
  <classifier>plugin</classifier>
  <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
----

Beside putting this jar into the classpath (along with its
dependencies) the only requirement is, that the Spring
application context needs to pickup
`classpath:META-INF/spring/jolokia.xml`. Luckily,
many Spring based containers like the
https://camel.apache.org/camel-maven-plugin.html[Camel
Maven Plugin] do this automatically for you, nothing
has to be configured here. Otherwise this
application context path has to be added manually, but in this case it is
probably easier to use the non-plugin version (without
classifier) and declare the Jolokia server explicitly in an
existing Spring configuration file as described above.

By default, the Jolokia agent starts on port 8778 on every
IP-Address of the host _without_
security.

The configuration can be tweaked via system properties as
described in
<<jvm-spring-system-properties>>. I.e. the plugin
doesn't specify any configuration on its own and uses a
`systemPropertiesMode` of
`fallback`.

As an alternative, the default settings can be customized by
providing a standalone
`<jolokia:config>` somewhere in the
Spring application context. An `order`
attribute can be used if multiple config declarations are
present: the higher the order, the higher the priority. But
then again, instead of using the plugin with an external
configuration it is probably better to us an explicit
`<jolokia:agent>` declaration, since
you have to add to a Spring configuration file anyway.
