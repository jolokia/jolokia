[#client-javascript]
== JavaScript Client Library

The Jolokia JavaScript library provides a JavaScript API to the
to the Jolokia agent. It comes with two layers, a
basic one which allows for sending Jolokia requests to the agent
synchronously or asynchronously and one with a simplified API
which is less powerful but easier to use. This library supports
bulk requests, HTTP GET and POST requests and JSONP for querying
agents which are located on a different server.

All methods of this library are available via the
`Jolokia` client object, which needs to be
instantiated up-front. In the following example a client object is
created and the used heap memory is requested synchronously via
the simple API. The agent is deployed within the same webarchive
which also serves this script.

[,javascript]
----
var j4p = new Jolokia("/jolokia");
var value = j4p.getAttribute("java.lang:type=Memory", "HeapMemoryUsage", "used");
console.log("Heap Memory used: " + value);
----

[#js-installation]
=== Installation

The Jolokia JavaScript library is distributed in two parts, in
compressed and uncompressed forms:

`jolokia.js` and `jolokia-min.js`:: Base library containing the Jolokia object definition
which carries the `request()`
`jolokia-simple.js` and `jolokia-simple-min.js`:: Library containing the Jolokia simple API and which builds
up on `jolokia.js` It must be included
after `jolokia.js` since it adds methods
to the `Jolokia` object definition.

All four files can be obtained from the
link:/download.html[download
page]. For production environments the compressed version
is highly recommended since the extensive API documentation
included in the original version is stripped off here. For Maven
users there is an even better way to integrate them, described in
<<js-maven>>.

`jolokia.js` uses
https://www.jquery.com[jQuery], which must be
included as well. If the target platform doesn't support native
JSON serialization,
https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js[json2.js]
needs to be included as well. As sample HTML head for including
all necessary parts looks like:

[,html]
----
<head>
  <script src="jquery-1.7.2.js"></script>
  <script src="json2.js"></script>
  <script src="jolokia-min.js"></script>
  <script src="jolokia-simple-min.js"></script>
</head>
----

A Jolokia client is always created as an instance of
`Jolokia`. Requests to the agent are sent
by calling methods on this object. The constructing function
takes a plain object, which provides default parameters which
are used in the `request()` if no
overriding are given there.

[#js-request]
=== Usage

All function of this library are available as methods of the
`Jolokia` object. The options needs to be
instantiated as usual and takes a set of default options, which
can be overwritten by subsequent requests. On the most basic
layer is a single `request()` method,
which takes two arguments: A request object and an optional
options object. For example, a synchronous request for obtaining
the agent's version for a agent running on the same server which
delivered the JavaScript looks like:

[,javascript]
----
var j4p = new Jolokia({ "url": "/jolokia" });
var response = j4p.request({ "type": "version" }, { "method": "post" });
console.log("Agent Version: " + response.value.agent);
----

If the constructor is used with a single string argument, this
value is considered to be the agent's access URL. I.e. in the
example above the construction of the
`Jolokia` could have been performed with a
single string argument (`new Jolokia("/jolokia")`).

[#js-request-format]
==== Requests

Jolokia requests and responses are represented as JSON
objects. They have exactly the same format, which is expected
and returned by the agent as defined in
<<protocol>> for POST requests. All request types are
supported.

The `request()` expects as its first
argument either a single request object or, for bulk requests,
an array of request objects. Depending on this for synchronous
operations either a single response JSON object is returned or
an array of responses (in the order of the initial request
array). For asynchronous request one or more callbacks are
called for each response separately. See
<<js-request-sync-async>> for details.

The following example shows a single and bulk request call to
the Jolokia agent:

[,javascript]
----
var j4p = new Jolokia({ "url": "/jolokia" });
var req1 = { "type": "read", "mbean": "java.lang:type=Memory", "attribute": "HeapMemoryUsage" };
var req2 = { "type": "list" };
var response = j4p.request(req1);
var responses = j4p.request([ req1, req2 ]);
----

[#s-request-options]
==== Request options

Each request can be influenced by a set of optional options
provided either as default during construction of the
`Jolokia` object or as optional last
parameter for the request object. Also a request can carry a
`config` attribute, which can be used for all
processing parameters (<<processing-parameters>>).
The known options are summarized in <<js-request-options-table>>

[#js-request-options-table]
.Request options
|===
|Key|Description

|`url`
|Agent URL (mandatory)

|`method`
|Either "post" or "get" depending on the desired HTTP method
(case does not matter).  Please note, that bulk requests are
not possible with "get". On the other hand, JSONP requests
are not possible with "post" (which obviously implies that
bulk request cannot be used with JSONP requests). Also, when
using a `read` type request for multiple
attributes, this also can only be sent as "post"
requests. If not given, a HTTP method is determined
dynamically. If a method is selected which doesn't fit to the
request, an error is raised.

|`jsonp`
|Whether the request should be sent via JSONP (a technique
for allowing cross domain request circumventing the infamous
"same-origin-policy"). This can be used only with HTTP "get"
requests.

|`success`
|Callback function which is called for a successful
request. The callback receives the response as single
argument. If no `success` callback is given, then
the request is performed synchronously and gives back the
response as return value. The value can be an array of
functions which is used for bulk requests to dispatch
multiple responses to multiple callbacks. See
<<js-request-sync-async>> for details.

|`error`
|Callback in case a Jolokia error occurs. A Jolokia error is
one, in which the HTTP request succeeded with a status code
of 200, but the response object contains a status other than
OK (200) which happens if the request JMX operation
fails. This callback receives the full Jolokia response
object (with a key `error` set). If no error
callback is given, but an asynchronous operation is
performed, the error response is printed to the JavaScript
console by default.

|`ajaxError`
|Global error callback called when the Ajax request itself
failed. It obtains the same arguments as the error callback
given for `jQuery.ajax()`, i.e. the
`XmlHttpResonse`, a text status and an
error thrown. Refer to the jQuery documentation for more
information about this error handler.

|`username`
|A username used for HTTP authentication

|`password`
|A password used for HTTP authentication

|`timeout`
|Timeout for the HTTP request

|`maxDepth`
|Maximum traversal depth for serialization of complex return values

|`canonicalProperties`
|Defaults to true for canonical (sorted) property lists on object names; if set to "false" then they are turned in their unsorted format.

|`maxCollectionSize`
|Maximum size of collections returned during serialization.
If larger, the collection is returned truncated.

|`maxObjects`
|Maximum number of objects contained in the response.

|`ignoreErrors`
|If set to "true", errors during JMX operations and JSON
serialization are ignored. Otherwise if a single
deserialization fails, the whole request returns with an
error. This works only for certain operations like pattern
reads.

|`serializeException`
|If true then in case of an error, the exception itself is returned in
it JSON representation under the key `error_value`
in the response object.

|`includeStackTrace`
|By default, a stacktrace is returned with every error (key: `stacktrace`)
This can be ommitted by setting the value of this option to false.

|`ifModifiedSince`
|The `LIST` operations provides an
optimization in that it remembers, when the set of
registered MBeans has been changes last. If a timestamp
(in epoch seconds) is provided with this parameter, then
the LIST operation returns an empty response
(i.e. `value` is null) and a
`status` code of 304 (Not Modified) if
the MBeans haven't changed. If you use the request
scheduler (<<js-request-options-table>>)
then this feature can be used to get the callbacks called
only if a value is returned. For the normal request, the
error callback is called which must check the status itself.

|===

[#js-request-sync-async]
==== Operational modes

Requests can be send either synchronously or asynchronously via
Ajax. If a `success` callback is given in the
request options, the request is performed asynchronously via an
Ajax HTTP request. The callback gets these arguments: a Jolokia JSON
response object (see <<request-response>>) and an
integer index indicating for which response this callback is being
called. For bulk requests, this index corresponds to the array
index of the request which lead to this response. The value of
this option can be an array of callback functions which are
called in a round robin fashion when multiple responses are
received in case of bulk requests. These callbacks are called
only when the returned Jolokia response has a status code of
`200`, otherwise the callback(s) given with
the `error` option are consulted. If no error
callback is given, the error is printed on the console by
default. As for success callbacks, error callbacks receive the
Jolokia error response as a JSON object.

The following example shows asynchronous requests for a single
Jolokia request as well as for bulk request with multiple
callbacks.

[,javascript]
----
var j4p = new Jolokia("/jolokia");

// Single request with a single success callback
j4p.request(
  {
    "type": "read",
    "mbean": "java.lang:type=Memory",
    "attribute": "HeapMemoryUsage"
  },
  {
    "success": function(response) {
      if (response.value.used / response.value.max > 0.9) {
        alert("90% of heap memory exceeded");
      }
    },
    "error": function(response) {
      alert("Jolokia request failed: " + response.error);
    }
  }
);

// Bulk request with multiple callbacks
j4p.request(
  [
    {
      "type": "read",
      "mbean": "java.lang:type=Threading",
      "attribute": "ThreadCount"
    },
    {
      "type": "read",
      "mbean": "java.lang:type=Runtime",
      "attribute": [ "VmName", "VmVendor" ]
    }
  ],
  {
    "success": [
      function(response) {
        console.log("Number of threads: " + response.value);
      },
      function(response) {
        console.log("JVM: " + response.value.VmName + " -- " + response.value.VmVendor);
      }
    ],
    "error": function(response) {
      alert("Jolokia request failed: " + response.error);
    }
  }
);
----

Both callbacks, `success` and
`error`, are only called when the Ajax
request succeeds. In case of an error on the HTTP level, the
callback `ajaxError` is called with the
`XMLHttpRequest`, a
`textStatus` and an optional exception
object. It has the same signature as the underlying
`error` callback of the
`jQuery.ajax()` call. (See the
https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/[jQuery documentation]
for details).

The Jolokia agent also supports
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP[JSONP] requests
for cases where the Jolokia agent is served on a different server or port
than the JavaScript client. By default, such access is forbidden by the so called
_same-origin-policy_. To switch on JSONP, the
option `jsonp` should be set to
`"true"`.

As explained in <<request-response>> the Jolokia
agent supports two HTTP methods, `GET` and
`POST`. `POST` is more
powerful since it supports more features. e.g. bulk requests and
JMX proxy requests are only possible with POST. By default, the
Jolokia JavaScript library selects an HTTP method automatically,
which is `GET` for simple cases and `POST`
for more sophisticated requests. The HTTP method can be
overridden by setting the option `method` to
`"get"` or `"post"`.

There are some limitations in choosing the HTTP method depending
on the request and other options given:

* Bulk requests (i.e. an array of multiple requests) can only be
used with `POST`.
* `READ` requests for multiple attributes
(i.e. the `attribute` request parameter is
an array of string values) can only be used with
`POST`.
* The JMX proxy mode (see <<proxy>>) can only be used
with `POST`.
* JSONP can only be used with `GET` and only
in asynchronous mode (i.e. a `success`
callback must be given). This is a limitation of the JSONP
technique itself.

The restrictions above imply, that JSONP can only be used for
single, simple requests and not for JMX proxy calls.

[#js-simple]
=== Simple API

Building upon the basic
`Jolokia.request()` method, a simplified
access API is available. It is contained in
`jolokia-simple.js` which must be included after
`jolokia.js`. This API provides dedicated
method for the various request types and supports all options as
described in <<js-request-options-table>>. There
is one notable difference for asynchronous callbacks and
synchronous return values though: In case of a successful call,
the callback is fed with the response's
`value` object, not the full response
(i.e. `response.value`). Similar, for synchronous
operations the value itself is returned. In case of an error,
either an `error` callback is called with the
full response object or an `Error` is
thrown for synchronous operations.

`getAttribute(mbean, attribute, path, opts)`:: This method returns the value of an JMX attribute
`attribute` of an MBean `mbean`. A path
can be optionally given, and the optional request options are
given as last argument(s). The return value for synchronous
operations are the attribute's value, for asynchronous
operations (i.e. `opts.success != null`) it is
`null`. See <<read>> for
details.
+
For example, the following method call can be used
to synchronously fetch the current heap memory usage:
+
[,javascript]
----
var memoryUsed = j4p.getAttribute("java.lang:type=Memory", "HeapMemoryUsage", "used");
----

`setAttribute(mbean, attribute, value, path, opts)`:: For setting an JMX attribute, this method takes the MBean's
name `mbean`, the attribute
`attribute` and the value to set as
`value`. The optional `path` is the
_inner path_ of the attribute on which
to set the value (see <<write>> for
details). The old value of the attribute is returned or
given to a `success` callback.
+
To enable verbose mode in the memory-handling beans, use
+
[,javascript]
----
var gsLoggingWasOn = j4p.setAttribute("java.lang:type=Memory", "Verbose", true);
----

`execute(mbean, operation, arg1, arg2, ..., opts)`:: With this method, a JMX operation can be executed on the
MBean `mbean`. Beside the operation's name
`operation`, one or more arguments can be given
depending on the signature of the JMX operation. The
return value is the return value of the operation. See
<<exec>> for details.
+
The following exampled asynchronously fetches a thread dump
as a JSON object and logs it into the console:
+
[,javascript]
----
j4p.execute("java.lang:type=Threading", "dumpAllThreads", true, true, {
  "success": function(value) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(value));
  }
});
----

`search(mBeanPattern, opts)`:: Searches for one or more MBeans whose object names fit the
pattern `mBeanPattern`. The return value is a list
of strings with the matching MBean names or `null`
if none is found. See <<search>> for details.
+
The following example looks up all application servers
available in all domains:
+
[,javascript]
----
var appServerNames = j4p.search("*:j2eeType=J2EEServer,*");
----

`list(path, opts)`:: For getting meta information about registered MBeans,
the `list` command can be used. The
optional `path` points into this meta
information for retrieving partial information. The format
of the return value is described in detail in
<<list>>.
+
This example fetches only the meta information for the
attributes of the
`java.lang:type=OperatingSystem` MBean:
+
[,javascript]
----
var attributesMeta = j4p.list("java.lang/type=OperatingSystem/attr");
----

`version(opts)`:: The `version` method returns the
agent's version, the protocol version, and possibly some
additional server-specific information. See
<<version>> for more information about this
method.
+
A sample return value for a GlassFish server looks like:
+
[,json]
----
{
  "protocol": "4.0",
  "agent": "0.82",
  "info": {
    "product": "glassfish",
    "vendor": "Sun",
    "extraInfo": {
      "amxBooted": false
    }
  }
}
----

[#js-poller]
=== Request scheduler

A `Jolokia` object can be also used for
periodically sending requests to the agent. Therefore requests
can be registered to the client object, and a poller can be
started and stopped. All registered requests are send at once
with a single bulk request so this is a quite efficient method for
periodically polling multiple values.

Here is a simple example, which queries the heap memory usage
every 10 seconds and prints out the used memory on the console:

[,javascript]
----
var j4p = new Jolokia("/jolokia")
handle = j4p.register(function(resp) {
  console.log("HeapMemory used: " + resp.value);
},
{
  "type": "READ",
  "mbean": "java.lang:type=Memory",
  "attribute": "HeapMemoryUsage", "path": "used"
});

j4p.start(10000);
----

`handle = j4p.register(callback, request, request,....)`:: This method registers one or more request for being
periodically fetched. `callback` can be either a
function or an object.
+
If a function is given or an object with an attribute
`callback` holding a function, then this
function is called with all responses received as
argument, regardless whether the individual response
indicates a success or error state.
+
If the first argument is an object with two callback
attributes `success` and `error`,
these functions are called for _each_ response
separately, depending whether the response indicates
success or an error state. If multiple requests have been
registered along with this callback object, the callback
is called multiple times, one for each request in the same
order as the request are given.  As second argument, the
handle which is returned by this method is given and as
third argument the index within the list of requests.
+
If the first argument is an object, an additional
`config` attribute with processing
parameters can be given which is used as default for the
registered requests. Requests with a
`config` section take precedence.
+
Furthermore, if a `onlyIfModified:
true` exists in the callback object, then the
`success` and `error`
callbacks are called only if the result changed on the
server side. Currently, this is supported for the
`list` operation only in which case the
callback is only called when MBean has been registered or
deregistered since the last call of the scheduler. If a
single `callback` function is used
which gets all responses for a job at once, then this
function is called only with the responses, which carry a
value. If none of the registered requests produced a
response with value (i.e. the server decided that there
was no update for any request), then a call to the callback function is
skipped completely.
+
`register()` returns a handle which can be used
later for unregistering these requests.
+
In the following example two requests are registered along
with a single callback function, which takes two responses
as arguments:
+
[,javascript]
----
handle = j4p.register(function(resp1, resp2) {
  console.log("HeapMemory used: " + resp1.value);
  console.log("ThreadCount: " + resp2.value);
},
{
  "type": "READ",
  "mbean": "java.lang:type=Memory",
  "attribute": "HeapMemoryUsage",
  "path": "used"
},
{
  "type": "READ",
  "mbean": "java.lang:type=Threading",
  "attribute": "ThreadCount"
});
----
+
In the next example, a dedicated `success`
and `error` callback are provided, which are
called individually for each request (in the given
order):
+
[,javascript]
----
j4p.register(
  {
    "success": function(resp) {
      console.log("MBean: " + resp.mbean + ", attr: " + resp.attribute + ", value: " + resp.value);
    },
    "error": function(resp) {
      console.log("Error: " + resp.error_text);
    },
    config: {
      "serializeException": true
    },
    "onlyIfModified": true
  },
  {
    "type": "LIST",
    "config": {
      "maxDepth": 2
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "READ",
    "mbean": "java.lang:type=Threading",
    "attribute": "ThreadCount",
    "config": {
      "ignoreErrors": true
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "READ",
    "mbean": "bla.blu:type=foo",
    "attribute": "blubber"
  }
);
----

`j4p.unregister(handle)`:: Unregister one or more requests registered with
`handle` so that they are no longer polled
with the scheduler.

`j4p.jobs()`:: Return an array of handles for all registered jobs. This array can be freely manipulated, its a copy of
the handle list.

`j4p.start(period)`:: Startup the scheduler for requeting the agent every
`period` milliseconds. If the scheduler is
already running, it adapts its scheduling period according
to the given argument. If no `period` is given,
the period provided during construction time (with the
option `fetchInterval`) is used. The default
value is 30 seconds.

`j4p.stop()`:: Stop the scheduler. If the scheduler is not running,
nothing happens. The scheduler can be restarted after it
has been stopped.

`j4p.isRunning()`:: Checks whether the scheduler is running. Returns
`true` if this is the case, `false`
otherwise.

[#js-cubism]
=== Jolokia as a Cubism Source

https://square.github.com/cubism/[Cubism] is a JavaScript library for
plotting time-series data and is based on <ulink
https://d3js.org/[d3.js]. Jolokia comes with a plugin for Cubism and
can act as a data source. The usage is quite simple: After
creating a Jolokia Cubism source, one or more JSON request can
be registered, which are queried periodically. No matter how
many requests are registered, only a single HTTP request is sent
to the server after each period. Cubism is then responsible for
plotting the data.

<<fig-jolokia-cubism-example>>  shows a sample for a memory plot. More examples can
be found on this link:../../client/javascript-cubism.html[page].

[#fig-jolokia-cubism-example]
.Horizon Chart for Heap-Memory Usage
image::jolokia-cubism-memory-horizon.png[]

`jolokia-cubism.js` can be downloaded from
the link:/download.html[downlad page] and also
comes with a minified version. As dependencies it requires
link:/download.html[jolokia.js],
https://www.jquery.com[JQuery],
https://square.github.com/cubism/[Cubism] and
https://d3js.org/[d3.js]. `jolokia-cubism.js`
registers itself as an <ulink
https://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html[AMD] module
if running within an AMD environment.

In order to use Jolokia with Cubism, you first need to create a
Cubism https://github.com/square/cubism/wiki/Context[context]. Next use
`context.jolokia()` for creating a connection to the
Jolokia agent.

[,javascript]
----
var context = cubism.context();

// Create a source for Jolokia metrics pointing to the agent
// at 'http://jolokia.org/jolokia'
var jolokia = context.jolokia("http://jolokia.org/jolokia");
----

The method `context.jolokia()` can take various
kind of arguments:

* A single string as in the example above is used as the
agent's URL. Additionally, options as key-value pairs can be
given as an additional argument. The possible keys are
described in <<js-request-options-table>>. If
the URL is omitted, but only an option object is provided,
then this object must also contain a key `url`
for specifying the agent URL.
* Alternatively, an already instantiated Jolokia object can be
provided as single argument, which then is used for all
communications to the server.

From this source object, a
https://github.com/square/cubism/wiki/Metric[metric]
object can be easily created. This metric object embraces one
or more Jolokia requests which are send to the server
periodically. The response(s) are then used for calculating a
single numerical value which gets plotted. For example:

[,javascript]
----
// Read periodically the Heap-Memory use and take 'HeapMemory Usage' as name/label.
var metricMem = jolokia.metric({
  "type": "read",
  "mbean": "java.lang:type=Memory",
  "attribute": "HeapMemoryUsage",
  "path": "used"
},
"HeapMemory Usage");

// Example for a callback function for evaluating responses
// dynamically. In this case, the first
// argument is a function, which gets feed with all response objects
// (one in this case). The requests objects are given next, and an
// options object as last argument.
var metricReq = jolokia.metric(
  function (resp) {
    var attrs = resp.value;
    var sum = 0;
    for (var key in attrs) {
      sum += attrs[key].requestCount;
    }
    return sum;
  },
  {
    "type": "read",
    "mbean": "Catalina:j2eeType=Servlet,*",
    "attribute": "requestCount"
  },
  {
    "name": "All",
    "delta": 101000
  }
);
----

`metric()` is a factory method which can be
called in various ways.

* If the first argument is a Jolokia request object (i.e. not
a function), this request is used for sending requests
periodically.
* If the first argument is a function, this function is used
for calculating the numeric value to be plotted. The rest of
the arguments can be one or more request objects, which are
registered and their responses are put as arguments to the
given callback function.
* The last argument, if an object but not a Jolokia request
(i.e. there is no `type` key), is
taken as an option object which is described below.
* Finally, if the last argument is a pure string, then this
string is used as name for the chart.

An object which can be given as last argument is used for fine
tuning the metrics:
`name`:: Name used in charts. The name can also be given
alternatively as a string directly as last argument (but
then without any other options)
`delta`:: Delta value in milliseconds for creating delta (velocity)
charts. This is done by taking the value measured
that many milliseconds ago and substract them from each other.
`keepDelay`:: How many milliseconds before the oldest shown value should be
kept in memory, which e.g. is necessary for delta
charts. When `delta` is given, this
value is implicitly set.

One or more metric objects can now be converted to charts and
added to a website with `d3.js`. This is done
in the usual cubism way as described here. In our example, in
order to append charts to a `div` with id
`chart` the following code can be used:

[,javascript]
----
// Use d3 to attach the metrics with a specific graph type
// ('horizon' in this case) to the document
d3.select("#charts").call(function(div) {
  div.append("div")
    .data([ metricMem, metricReq ])
    .call(context.horizon())
});

[#js-maven]
=== Maven integration

For Maven users' convenience, the Jolokia JavaScript package is
also available as a JavaScript artifact. It can be easily
included with help of the
`javascript-maven-plugin`.

.Recommended plugin
****
Unfortunately, the "official" version of this plugin hosted on
Codehaus has been stuck at version
`1.0-alpha-1-SNAPSHOT`. Although it is quite
usable, in order to avoid a snapshot dependency, it is
recommended to use a fork of this plugin hosted on
https://github.com/harlanji/javascript-maven-tools[GitHub] and deployed at the
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public[Sonatype Maven repository].
****

The following example shows a sample configuration which could
be used within a `pom.xml`:

[,xml]
----
<project>
  ...
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.jolokia</groupId>
      <artifactId>jolokia-client-javascript</artifactId>
      <type>javascript</type>
      <version>1.0.5</version>
    </dependency>
    ....
  </dependencies>

  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>com.devspan.mojo.javascript</groupId>
        <artifactId>javascript-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>0.9.3</version>
        <extensions>true</extensions>
        <configuration>
          <useArtifactId>false</useArtifactId>
        </configuration>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>war-package</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
    ...
  </build>
  ...
  <pluginRepositories>
    <pluginRepository>
      <id>sonatype-oss</id>
      <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public</url>
    </pluginRepository>
  </pluginRepositories>
  ...
</project>

Then, in your webapp project, `jolokia.js`,
`jolokia-simple.js` and
`json2.js` can be found in the
`scripts/lib` directory (relative to the
top level of you WAR). In order to include it in your HTML
files use something like this:

[,html]
----
<head>
  <script src="jquery-1.7.2.js"></script>
  <script src="scripts/libk/json2.js"></script>
  <script src="scripts/lib/jolokia.js"></script>
  <script src="scripts/lib/jolokia-simple.js"></script>
</head>
----

`jQuery.js` has to be included on its own,
though and is not included within the dependency. If the
compressed version of `jolokia.js` should
be used, add a
`classifier="compressed"` to the
`jolokia-client-javascript` dependency, and
include `scripts/lib/jolokia-min.js`

A full working example can be found in the Jolokia sources at
`client/javascript/test-app/pom.xml`.
