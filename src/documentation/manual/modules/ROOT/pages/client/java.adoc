== Java Client Library

The Java client library provides an easy access to the Jolokia
agent from within Java. Since JSR-160 connectors themselves
provide Java based remote access to MBeans one might wonder about
the benefits of  a Jolokia Java binding. There are several,
though:

* It provides a typeless access to remote MBeans. The big
advantage is that for any non-OpenMBean access to custom typed
objects is still possible without having the type information
locally in the classpath.
* Jolokia can be used in setups where JSR-160 connectors can not
be used. I.e. in firewall secured environments it is much easier
to get through to a Jolokia Agent than to an JSR-160 connector
using RMI as transport protocol.
* _Remoteness_ is explicit in this API instead
of JSR-160 connector's seeked _transparent
remoteness_. RMI has some arguable conceptually
advantages, but hiding all remote aspects proved to have quite
some disadvantages when it comes to the programming
model. Explicit awareness of a 'heavy-weight' remote call is
better than false transparency in order to know the price tag.

The Java client library follows a strict request-response
paradigm, much like the underlying HTTP. It uses generics heavily
and can be centered around three classes:
`J4pClient` is the client side agent, which
has various variants of a `execute()` for
sending requests. This method takes one or more
`J4pRequest` objects as arguments and returns
one or more `J4pResponse` objects as result.

.What the heck is this "J4p"?
****
That's a reminiscence to Jolokia's roots which lies in
https://www.jmx4perl.org[Jmx4Perl]. It is always good
to remember where one comes from ;-)
****

But before we got into the details, the next section gives a first
tutorial to get a feeling how the API can be used.

[#client-java-tutorial]
=== Tutorial

As seen in the following example, the usage is quite easy. First
a, client object `client` is created pointing
to a Jolokia agent at `\http://localhost:8080/jolokia`.
A read request for querying the heap memory usage from the
`MemoryMXBean` is created and then send via
the `execute()` to the agent. The
response returned is of type
`J4pReadResponse` and holds the result
which finally is printed out to standard output.

[,java]
----
import org.jolokia.client.J4pClient;
import org.jolokia.client.request.*;

public class MemoryDemo {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    J4pClient client = new J4pClient("http://localhost:8080/jolokia");
    J4pReadRequest request =
        new J4pReadRequest("java.lang:type=Memory", "HeapMemoryUsage");
    request.setPath("used");
    J4pReadResponse response = client.execute(request);
    System.out.println("Memory used: " + response.getValue());
  }
}
----

In order to compile and run this sample, two support libraries
are required in addition to
`jolokia-client-java.jar` (link:../../download.html[Download]):

* Apache
https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/index.html[HttpClient],
4.3.3 (https://hc.apache.org/downloads.cgi[Download])
* https://code.google.com/p/json-simple/[json-simple],
1.1 (https://code.google.com/p/json-simple/downloads/list[Download])

For Maven users, the following dependency is sufficient (it will include
the other two as transitive dependencies):

[,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.jolokia</groupId>
  <artifactId>jolokia-client-java</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.2</version>
</dependency>

[#client-client]
=== J4pClient

`J4pClient` is the entry point for sending
requests to a remote Jolokia agent. It can be created in multiple
ways. For simple cases, public constructors are provided taking
the mandatory Jolokia agent URL and optionally a
`org.apache.http.client.HttpClient`
instance which is used for the HTTP business. The recommended style
is to use the `J4pClientBuilder`, though. This way, all
parameters for the HTTP communication can easily be set:

[,java]
----
J4pClient j4p = J4pClient.url("http://localhost:8080/jolokia")
  .user("roland")
  .password("s!cr!t")
  .authenticator(new BasicAuthenticator().preemptive())
  .connectionTimeout(3000)
  .build();
----

The builder supports the following parameters with the given
defaults:

.J4pClient parameters
|===
|Parameter|Description|Default

|`url`
|The URL to the Jolokia agent. This is the only mandatory parameter.
|

|`user`
|User name when authentication is used. If not set, no
authentication is used. If set, `password`
must be set, too
|

|`password`
|Password used for authentication. Only used when
`user` is set.
|

|`authenticator`
|Implementation of `J4pAuthenticator`. The Java client comes with
one implementation `BasicAuthenticator` for using basic authentication.
This class supports also _preemptive_ authentication. Call `preemptive()` to
switch this on (see above for an example). Basic authentication is the default if no other
authenticator is set.Only used when `user` is set, too.
|

|`target`
|A JMX JSR-160 ServiceURL which should be used by the agent
as the _real_ target. This parameter should
be set if the client is used for accessing the agent in
<<proxy,proxy mode>>.
|

|`targetUser`
|The JSR-160 user to use when using the proxy mode. If not
given (and `target` is set), then no
authentication is used for JSR-160 communication.
|

|`targetPassword`
|JSR-160 Password to use for the proxy mode.
|

|`connectionTimeout`
|The timeout in milliseconds until a connection is
established. A timeout value of zero is interpreted as an
infinite timeout.
|`20000`

|`pooledConnection`
|Specifies, that the underlying HttpClient should use pooled
connection manager, which is thread safe and can service
connection requests from multiples threads
simultaneously. This is important if the
`J4pClient` is to be used in a multi
threaded context. The size of the pool is restricted by the
parameter `maxTotalConnection`.
`ThreadSafeClientConnManager` is the
underlying connection manager. Pooled connections are the
default.
|

|`singleConnection`
|Specifies that single connection should be used which
maintains only one active connection at a time.  Even though
`J4pClient` is still thread-safe it
ought to be used by one execution thread only. The
underlying connection manager is
`SingleClientConnManager` Pooled
connections are the default.
|

|`maxTotalConnections`
|Defines the number of total connections to be pooled. It
is only used when `pooledConnection` is
used.
|`20`

|`defaultMaxConnectionsPerRoute`
|Defines the number of total connections per route. It
is only used when `pooledConnection` is
used.
|`20`

|`maxConnectionPoolTimeout`
|Defines the timeout for waiting to obtain a connection
from the pool. This parameter is only used when
`pooledConnections` are used.
|`500`

|`socketTimeout`
|Defines the socket timeout (`SO_TIMEOUT`) in milliseconds,
which is the timeout for waiting for data  or, put differently,
a maximum period inactivity between two consecutive data packets.
A timeout value of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout.
|`0`

|`contentCharset`
|Defines the charset to be used per default for encoding
content body.
|`ISO-8859-1`

|`expectContinue`
|Activates `Expect: 100-Continue` handshake
for the entity enclosing methods.  The purpose of the
`Expect: 100-Continue` handshake to allow a
client that is sending a request message with a request body
to determine if the origin server is willing to accept the
request (based on the request headers) before the client
sends the request body.  The use of the `Expect:
100-continue` handshake can result in noticeable
performance improvement for entity enclosing requests that
require the target server's authentication.
|`true`

|`tcpNoDelay`
|Determines whether Nagle's algorithm is to be used. The
Nagle's algorithm tries to conserve bandwidth by minimizing
the number of segments that are sent. When applications wish
to decrease network latency and increase performance, they
can disable Nagle's algorithm (that is enable
`TCP_NODELAY`). Data will be sent
earlier, at the cost of an increase in bandwidth
consumption.
|true

|`socketBufferSize`
|Determines the size of the internal socket buffer in bytes
used to buffer data while receiving and transmitting HTTP
messages.
|`8192`

|`proxy`
|Determines http proxy server. It can be defined as
`http://user:password@host:port`. _user_ and
_password_ are optional.
|

|`useProxyFromEnvironment`
|Set the proxy for this client based on `http_proxy` system environment variable.
Expect formats are `http://user:pass@host:port` or `http://host:port`
Example: `http://tom:sEcReT@my.proxy.com:8080`
|

|`responseExtractor`
|A response extractor can be used for hooking into the JSON
deserialization process when a JSON response is converted
into a `J4pResponse` object. By
default, the received JSON object is examined for a status
code of 200 and only then creates a response
object. Otherwise an exception is thrown. An extractor is
specified by the interface
`J4pResponseExtractor`. Beside the
default extractor, an alternate extractor
`ValidatingResponseExtractor` can be
used, which instead of throwing an exception returns a
`null` object when the response has a status of
404. An extractor can be specified as extra argument to the
execute method, too.
|
|===

The `J4pClient` provides various variants
of a `execute()` method, which takes
either one single request or a list of requests. For a single
request, the preferred HTTP method (GET or POST) can be
specified optionally. The `List<R>`
argument can be used type only for a homogeneous bulk request,
i.e. for multiple requests of the same time. Otherwise an
untyped list must be used.

Each request can be tuned by giving a map of processing options
along with their values to the `execute`
method. The possible options are shown in table
<<client-java-queryopts>>.

[#client-java-queryopts]
.J4pClient query parameters
|===
|J4pQueryParameter enum|Description

|`MAX_DEPTH`
|Maximum traversal depth for serialization of complex
objects. Use this with a "list" request to restrict the
depth of the returned meta data tree.

|`MAX_COLLECTION_SIZE`
|Maximum size of collections returned during serialization.
If larger, a collection is truncated to this size.

|`MAX_OBJECTS`
|Maximum number of objects returned in the response's value.

|`IGNORE_ERRORS`
|Option for ignoring errors during JMX operations and JSON
serialization.  This works only for certain operations like
pattern reads and should be either `true`
or `false`.

|`INCLUDE_STACKTRACE`
|Whether to include a stack trace in the response when an
error occurs.  The allowed values are
`true` for inclusion,
`false` if no stacktrace should be
included or `runtime` if only
`RuntimeException`s should be
included. Default is `true`.

|`SERIALIZE_EXCEPTION`
|Whether to include a JSON serialized version of the
exception. If set to `true`, the exception
is added under the key `error_value` in
the response. Default is `false`.

|`CANONICAL_NAMING`
|Whether property keys of `ObjectNames`
should be ordered in the canonical way or in the way that
they are created. The allowed values are either
`true` in which case the canonical key
order (== alphabetical sorted) is used or
`false` for getting the keys as
registered. Default is `true`

|===

[#client-java-requests]
=== Request types

For each request type a dedicated request object is provided
which all are subclasses from
`J4pRequest`. For all requests it can be
specified which HTTP method is to be used by setting the
property `preferredHttpMethod` to either
`GET` or `POST`.

Each request type has a corresponding response type which used
for the return values of the
`J4pClient.execute()`.

The constructor of each kind of request can take a
`J4pTargetConfig` as argument for using a
request in <<proxy,proxy mode>>. This
configurational object holds the JMX service url and
(optionally) credentials for JSR-160 authentication. When
given, this proxy target specification overrides any default
proxy configuration set during the initialization of the
`J4pClient`.

`J4pReadRequest` and `J4pReadResponse`:: `J4pReadRequest` is a read request to
get one or more attributes from one or more MBeans within
a single request. Various constructor variants can be used
to specify one or more attributes along with the
ObjectName (which can be a pattern). A
`path` can be set as property for
specifying an _inner path_, too.
+
`J4pReadResponse` is the
corresponding response type and allows typed access to the
fetched value for a single attribute fetch or to multiple
values for a multi attribute read. In the latter case, the
found object and attributes names can be retrieved as
well.
+
For more information on fetching the value of multiple
attributes and multiple MBeans at once, please refer to
<<read>> or the Javadoc of
`J4pReadResponse`.

`J4pWriteRequest` and `J4pWriteResponse`:: A `J4pWriteRequest` is used to set
the value of an MBean attribute. Beside the mandatory
object and attribute name the value must be give in the
constructor as well. Optionally a `path`
can be provided, too. Only certain types for the given
value can be serialized properly for calling the Jolokia
agent as described in
<<serialization-request>>.
+
The old value is returned as `J4pWriteResponse`'s value.

`J4pExecRequest` and `J4pExecResponse`:: ``J4pExecRequest``'s are used for
executing operation on MBeans. The constructor takes as
mandatory arguments the MBean's object name, the operation
name and any arguments required by the operation. Only
certain types for the given arguments can be serialized
properly for calling the Jolokia agent as described in
<<serialization-request>>.
+
The returned `J4pExecResponse`
contains the return value of the operation called.

`J4pSearchRequest` and `J4pSearchResponse`:: A `J4pSearchRequest` contains a
valid single MBean object name pattern which is used for
searching MBeans.
+
The `J4pSearchResponse` holds a
list of found object names.

`J4pListRequest` and `J4pListResponse`:: For obtaining meta data on MBeans a
`J4pListRequest` should be used. It
can be used with a _inner path_ to
obtain only a subtree of the response, otherwise the whole
tree as described in <<response-list>> is
returned. With the query parameter
`maxDepth` can be used to restrict the
depth of returned tree.
+
The single value of a
`J4pListResponse` is a tree (or
subtree) as a JSON object, which has the format described
in <<response-list>>.

`J4pVersionRequest` and `J4pVersionResponse`:: A `J4pVersionRequest` request the
Jolokia agent's version information and takes no
argument.
+
The `J4pVersionResponse` returns the
agent's version (`agentVersion`), the
protocol version (`protocolVersion`), the
application server product name
(`product`), the vendor name
(`vendor`) and any extra info
(`extraInfo`) specific to the platform
the Jolokia is running on.

[#client-java-exceptions]
=== Exceptions

In case of an error when executing a request a
`J4pException` or one its subclass is
thrown.

`J4pConnectException`:: Exception thrown when the connection to the server
fails. It contains the original
`ConnectException` as nested value.

`J4pTimeoutException`:: Exception thrown in case of an timeout. The nested
exception is of type
`ConnectTimeoutException`.

`J4pRemoteException`:: Generic exception thrown when an exception occurred on the
remote side. This is the case when the JSON response
obtained is an error response as described in
<<responses>>. The error type, error value, the
status, the request leading to this error and the remote
stacktrace as string) can be obtained from this exception.

`J4pBulkRemoteException`:: Exception thrown when a bulk request fails on the remote
side. This contains a mixed list which contains the
`J4pRemoteException` occurred as well
as the `J4pResponse` objects for the
requests, which succeeded. The list obtained by
`getResults()` contains these
objects in the same order as the list of requests given to
`execute`. All responses and remote
exceptions can also be obtained separately in homogeneous
lists.

`J4pException`:: Base exception thrown, when no other exception fits,
i.e. when the exception happened on the client side. The
original exception is contained as nested exception.
