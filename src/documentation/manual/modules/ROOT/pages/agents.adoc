Jolokia is an agent based approach to JMX, which requires that clients
install an extra piece of software, the so-called
_agent_. This software either needs to be
deployed on the target server which should be accessed via remote
JMX (xref:architecture.adoc#agent-mode[Agent mode]), or it can be installed on a
dedicated proxy server (xref:architecture.adoc#proxy-mode[Proxy Mode]). For both
operational modes, there are four different kind of
agentsfootnote:[Although the proxy mode is available for all four agents, you
are normally free to setup the proxy environment. The
recommendation here is the war-agent for which very
lightweight servlet container exists. Tomcat or Jetty are both
a perfect choice for a Jolokia proxy server.].

_Webarchive (War) agent_::
This agent is packaged as a Java EE Webarchive (War). It is the
standard installation artifact for Java webapplications and
probably one of the best known deployment formats. Jolokia ships
with a war-agent which can be deployed like any other web
application. This agent has been tested on many Java EE
servers, from well-known market leaders to rarer species.

_OSGi agent_::
https://www.osgi.org[OSGi] is a middleware specification
focusing on modularity and a well defined dynamic lifecyclefootnote:[Of course, there is much more to OSGi, a platform and
programing model which I _really_
like. This is my personal pet agent, so to speak ;-).]. The Jolokia OSGi agent
bundles comes in two
flavors: a minimal one with a dependency on a running
https://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v42/org/osgi/service/http/HttpService.html[OSGi
HttpService], and a all-in-one bundle including an
embedded _HttpService_ implementation
(which is exported, too). The former is the recommended,
puristic solution, the later is provided for a quick startup
for initial testing the OSGi agent (but should be replaced
with the minimal bundle for production setups).

_JVM agent_::
Starting with Java 6 the JDK provided by Oracle contains a
lightweight HTTP-Server which is used e.g. for the reference
WebService stack implementation included in Java 6. Using
the Java-agent API (normally used by profilers and other
development tools requiring the instrumentation during the
class loading phase), the JVM 6 Jolokia agent is the most
generic one. It is able to instrument _any_
Java application running on a Oracle JDK 6footnote:[
You could even instrument a Java EE application server this way,
however this is not recommended.].
This Jolokia agent variant is fully featured, however tends to
be a bit slow since the
provided HTTP-Server is not optimized for performance. However
it is useful for servers like Hadoop or Teracotta, which do
not provide convenient hooks for an HTTP-exporting agent on
their own.
