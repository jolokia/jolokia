= Agents

Jolokia is an agent based approach to JMX, which requires that clients
install an extra piece of software, the so-called
_agent_. This software either needs to be
deployed on the target server which should be accessed via remote
JMX (xref:architecture.adoc#agent-mode[Agent mode]), or it can be installed on a
dedicated proxy server (xref:architecture.adoc#proxy-mode[Proxy Mode]). For both
operational modes, there are three different kinds of
agentsfootnote:[Although the proxy mode is available for all three agents, you
are normally free to setup the proxy environment. The
recommendation here is the WAR agent for which very
lightweight servlet container exists. Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow are all
a perfect choice for a Jolokia proxy server.].

_Webarchive (War) agent_::
This agent is packaged as a Jakarta EE Web archive (WAR). It is the
standard installation artifact for Java web applications and
probably one of the best known deployment formats. Jolokia ships
with a WAR agent which can be deployed like any other web
application. This agent has been tested on many Jakarta EE
servers, from well-known market leaders to rarer species.

_OSGi agent_::
https://www.osgi.org[OSGi] is a middleware specification
focusing on modularity and a well defined dynamic lifecyclefootnote:[Of course, there is much more to OSGi, a platform and
programing model which I _really_
like. This is my personal pet agent, so to speak ;-).]. The Jolokia 1.x OSGi agent
used to come in two flavors (with and without packaged https://github.com/apache/felix-dev/tree/master/http[Felix HTTP Service,role=externalLink,window=_blank] bundles). With Jolokia 2 there's only one bundle
which requires a https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/8.1.0/service.servlet.html[OSGi CMPN Whiteboard extender,role=externalLink,window=_blank] implementation available in target OSGi runtime.

_JVM agent_::
Starting with Java 6 the JDK provided by Oracle contains a
lightweight HTTP-Server which is used e.g. for the reference
WebService stack implementation included in Java 6. Using
the Java-agent API (normally used by profilers and other
development tools requiring the instrumentation during the
class loading phase), the JVM 11+ Jolokia agent is the most
generic one. It is able to instrument _any_
Java application running on a Oracle JDK 11+footnote:[
You could even instrument a Jakarta EE application server this way,
however this is not recommended because WAR agent is much more suitable.].
This Jolokia agent variant is fully featured, however tends to
be a bit slow since the
provided HTTP-Server is not optimized for performance. However
it is useful for servers like Hadoop or Teracotta, which do
not provide convenient hooks for an HTTP-exporting agent on
their own.

== Configuration

A note about configuration options - all agents read options from various sources:

* WAR Agent may use servlet parameters and servlet context parameters
* OSGi Agent may use Config Admin PIDs
* JVM Agent may use command line options available from argument of `premain()` method

Since Jolokia 2.2.0 we've unified configuration usage a bit - previously only `agentId` and `discoveryAgentUrl` could reference environment variables and system properties and `policyLocation` and `agentId` could use properties like `${host}` to be dynamically resolved to current host name.

Now all properties may use placeholders in the form of:

* `${sys:configurationOption}` (or `${prop:configurationOption}`) to reference system properties
* `${env:VARIABLE_NAME}` to reference environment variables
* `${ip}`, `${ip6}`, `${host}`, `${ip:<interface>}` (e.g., `${ip:eth0}`) to reference networking configuration. `${host}` is resolved to actuall name only if `allowDnsReverseLookup` option is set to `true`. When not (which is the default), the value is the same as `${ip}`.

Additionally if Jolokia detects:

* environment variables with `JOLOKIA_` prefix
* system properties with `jolokia.` prefix

these configuration options may be used as well if not overridden by explicit JVM Agent option or Servlet Config parameter.

For example, environment variable `JOLOKIA_AUTH_CLASS` may be checked if there's no `authClass` option specified in other property source.
