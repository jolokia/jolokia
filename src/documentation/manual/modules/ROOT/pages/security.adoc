[#security]
= Security

Security in JSR-160 remoting is an all-or-nothing option. Either
all or none of your MBeans are accessible (except when your application server
uses a SecurityManager, but that is not often the case). Jolokia, on
the other hand, allows for fine grained security defined in an
XML security policy file. It allows for access restrictions on
MBean names (or patterns), attributes, operations, source IP
address (or a subnet) and type of Jolokia operation.

[#security-policy]
== Policy based security

Access to MBean and to the Jolokia agents in general can be
restricted with an XML policy file. This policy can be configured
for various parameters and is divided into several sections.

=== IP based restrictions

Overall access can be granted based on the IP address of an
HTTP client. These restrictions are
specified within a `<remote>` section,
which contains one or more `<host>`
elements. The source can be given either as an IP address,
a host name, or a netmask given in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing[CIDR format]
(e.g. `10.0.0.0/16` for all clients coming from the 10.0
network). The following allows access from localhost and all
clients whose IP addresses start with "10.0". For all other
IP addresses access is denied.

[,xml]
----
<remote>
  <host>localhost</host>
  <host>10.0.0.0/16</host>
</remote>
----

=== Commands

This section specifies the Jolokia commands for which access
is generally granted. For each command in the list, access can
be further restricted within the
`<deny>` part and each command
missing in the list, which is forbidden globally, can be
selectively enabled for certain MBeans in the
`<allow>` section. If the
`<commands>` section is missing
completely, access to all commands is allowed.

All Jolokia commands described in
xref:jolokia_protocol.adoc[] can be used in this section:

read:: Reading of MBean attributes
write:: Setting of MBean attributes
exec:: Execution of JMX operations
list:: List the available MBeans along with their supported
search:: Searching for MBeans
version:: Getting version and server information

In the following example, access is granted to the
`read`, `list`,
`search` and `version` command, but
not to `write` and `exec`
operations.

[,xml]
----
<commands>
  <command>read</command>
  <command>list</command>
  <command>version</command>
  <command>search</command>
</commands>
----

=== Allow and deny access to certain MBeans</title>

Within an `<allow>` section, access
to MBeans can be granted regardless of the
operations specified in the
`<commands>` section. The reverse is
true for the `<deny>` section: It
rejects access to the MBeans specified here. Both sections
contain one or more `<mbean>`
elements which have a format like:

[,xml]
----
<mbean>
  <name>java.lang:type=Memory</name>
  <attribute>*Memory*</attribute>
  <attribute mode="read">Verbose</attribute>
  <operation>gc</operation>
</mbean>
----

Within the `<name>` section the name
of the MBean is specified. This can be either a complete
ObjectName or a MBean pattern containing wildcards. The
value given here must conform to the JMX specification for a
valid `ObjectName`. On this MBean (or
_MBeans_ if `name` is a pattern),
attributes are specified within one or more
`<attribute>` elements and operations
within one or more `<operation>`
elements. The content can also be a pattern, which uses a wildcard
`\*`. e.g. `<attribute>*</attribute>`
specifies all attributes on the given MBean. If for an
`<attribute>` element the XML
attribute `mode="read"` is given, then this
attribute can be accessed only read-only.

=== HTTP method restrictions

Finally, access can be restricted based on the HTTP method
with which an Jolokia request was received with the
`<http>` element. Method allowed
(`post` or `get`) are
specified with an `<method>` inner
element. The following example restricts the access to POST
requests only:

[,xml]
----
<http>
  <method>post</method>
</http>
----

It the `<http>` section is missing
completely, any HTTP method can be used.

=== Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions

Jolokia (since version 1.0.3) supports the W3C specification
for https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/[Cross-Origin
Resource Sharing] (also known as "CORS") which allows
browser to access resources which are located on a different
server than the calling script is loaded from. This
specification provides a controlled way to come around the
_same origin policy_. Most
https://caniuse.com/#search=CORS[contemporary
browsers] support CORS.

By default Jolokia allows cross origin access from any
host. This can be limited to certain hosts by using
`<allow-origin>` sections within a
`<cors>` sections. This tags can
contain the origin URL provided by browsers with the
`Origin:` header literally or a
wildcard specification with `*`.

[,xml]
----
<cors>
  <!-- Allow cross origin access from www.jolokia.org ... -->
  <allow-origin>https://www.jolokia.org</allow-origin>

  <!-- ... and all servers from jmx4perl.org with any protocol -->
  <allow-origin>*://*.jmx4perl.org</allow-origin>

  <!-- Check for the proper origin on the server side, too -->
  <strict-checking/>
</cors>
----

If the option `<strict-checking/>` is given in this section, too, then the given patterns
are not only used for CORS checking but also every request is checked on the server side whether the
`Origin:` or `Referer:` header matches one of the given patterns.
If neither `Origin:` nor `Referer:` is given and strict checking is enabled, then the access is denied. This useful for protecting against Cross-Site Request Forgery.

Please note that `<strict-checking/>` might not be good enough because of potential
browser bugs which could allow to forge the origin header. Examples of these issues are
https://blog.bentkowski.info/2018/06/setting-arbitrary-request-headers-in.html[arbitrary header injection]
or https://www.brokenbrowser.com/referer-spoofing-defeating-xss-filter/[referer and origin
spoofing]. User facing application which uses Jolokia has backend should consider to implement
additional measures like using the
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-first-party-cookies-07[same-site] flag
on the session cookie.

=== Example for a security policy

The following complete example applies various access
restrictions:

* Access is only allowed for clients coming from localhost
* Only HTTP Post requests are allowed
* By default, only `read` and `list` requests are allowed.
* A single `exec` request is allowed for triggering garbage collection.
* Read access to the C3P0 connection pool is restricted to
forbid fetching the pool's properties, which in fact
contains the DB password as clear text.

[#security-policy-location]
=== Policy Location

****
A great tool which helps in repackaging an agent for
inclusion of a `jolokia-access.xml`
policy file
is the command line tool
https://search.cpan.org/~roland/jmx4perl/scripts/jolokia[jolokia],
which comes with the
https://www.jmx4perl.org[jmx4perl] distribution. See
xref:tools.adoc[] for an introduction.
****

But how do the agents lookup the policy file ? By default,
the agents will lookup for a policy file top-level in the
classpath under the name
`jolokia-access.xml`. Hence for the war
agent, the policy file must be packaged within the war at
`WEB-INF/classes/jolokia-access.xml`, for
all other agents at
`/jolokia-access.xml`. The location can
be overwritten with the configuration parameter
`policyLocation`, which has to be set
differently depending on the agent type. Please refer to
xref:agents.adoc[] for more details. The value of this
init parameter can be any URL which can loaded by the JVM. A
special case is an URL with the scheme
`classpath:` which results in a lookup of
the policy file within the classpath. As stated above, the
default value of this parameter is
`classpath:/jolokia-access.xml`. If a
non-classpath URL is provided with this parameter, and the
target policy file could not be found then access is
completely denied. If a classpath lookup fails then access
is globally granted and a warning is given on standard
output.

The parameter specified with `policyLocation` can contain placeholders:

* `$ip`: IP - Address
* `$host`: Host - Address
* `$\{prop:foo}`: System property _foo_
* `$\{env:FOO}`: Environment variable _FOO_

[#security-restrictor]
== Jolokia Restrictors

In order to provide fine grained security, Jolokia using the
abstract concept of an _Restrictor_. It is
represented by the Java interface
`org.jolokia.core.service.Restrictor` and
comes with several implementations. The most prominent one is
the `PolicyRestrictor` which is described
in <<security-policy>>. This is also the
restrictor which is active by default. For special needs, it is
possible to provide a custom implementation of this
interface for the WAR and OSGi agents. It is recommended to
subclass either
`org.jolokia.core.restrictor.AllowAllRestrictor`
or
`org.jolokia.core.restrictor.DenyAllRestrictor`.

For the WAR agent (xref:agents.adoc#agents-war[Java EE Agent (WAR)]), a subclass
of `org.jolokia.core.http.AgentServlet` should
be created which overrides the
`createRestrictor()`

[,java]
----
public class RestrictedAgentServlet extends AgentServlet {

  @Override
  protected Restrictor createRestrictor(String policyLocation) {
    return new MyOwnRestrictor();
  }
}
----

`policyLocation` is a URL pointing to the
policy file, which is either the default value
`classpath:/jolokia-access.xml` or the
value specified with the init parameter
`policyLocation`. This servlet can then be
easily configured in a custom `web.xml`
the same way as the Jolokia agent.

For programmatic usage there is an even simpler way:
`AgentServlet` provides an constructor
which takes an restrictor as argument, so no subclassing is
required in this case.

For an OSGi agent (xref:agents.adoc#agents-osgi[OSGi Agents]),
`org.jolokia.server.core.osgi.servlet.JolokiaServlet`
is the proper extension point. It can be subclassed the same
way as shown above and allows a restrictor implementation as
constructor parameter, too. In contrast to
`AgentServlet` this class is also OSGi
exported and can be referenced from other
bundles. Additionally, the OSGi agent can also pick up a
restrictor as an OSGi service. See
xref:agents.adoc#agents-osgi[OSGi Agents] for details.
