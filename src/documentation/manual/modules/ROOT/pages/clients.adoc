= Clients

Three client implementations exists for Jolokia: Jmx4Perl, the
Perl binding (the grandmother of all clients ;-), a Java library
and a JavaScript library. This reference describes the client
bindings bundled with Jolokia. More JVM based client libraries
are planned for inclusion in Jolokia (e.g. Groovy, Scala or
JRuby). Information about Jmx4Perl can be found
https://www.jmx4perl.org[elsewhere].
