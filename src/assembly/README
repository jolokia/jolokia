                           JMX on Capsaicin
                           ================


Jolokia is a fresh way for accessing JMX MBeans remotely. It is
different to JSR-160 connectors in so far as it is an agent based
approach which uses JSON over HTTP for its communication in a
REST-stylish way.

Agents
------

Multiple agents are provided for different environments:

  * WAR Agent for deployment as web application in a JEE Server 
  
  * OSGi Agent for deployment in an OSGi container. This agent is
    packaged as a bundle and comes in two flavors (minimal,
    all-in-one)
  
  * Mule Agent for usage within a Mule ESB
  
  * JVM JDK6 Agent which can be used with any Oracle/Sun JVM,
    Version 6 

All agents can be found in the agents/ subdirectory. For installation
instructions, please refer to http://www.jolokia.org/agent.html

JMX Support Libraries
---------------------

Below jmx/ there are support libraries when using the JMX
 agent programatically. I.e. there is Spring support including
an own jolokia Configuration Syntax and extended JMX support
like @JsonMBean.

Client Library
--------------

This binary distributions contains the Jolokia client libraries below
the client/ directory. For usage and installation instructions and
example, please refer to reference documentation.

Reference documentation
-----------------------

Jolokia's reference documentation is contained below reference/ and
comes in two flavors: As a set of HTML documents
(reference/html/index.html) and a rendered PDF document
(reference/jolokia.pdf)
