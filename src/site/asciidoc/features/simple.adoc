For Jolokia to work, an agent must be deployed, the one way or
the other. But this is a common business:

* The link:../agent/war.html[WAR Agent] gets deployed as any other
Java EE web application. Often this is as simpe as a simple
copy of the agent war-artifact into a certain directory
(like for Tomcat). Or it gets deployed via an administrative
user interface (web GUI or command line tool). In any case,
the procedure should be familar to any Java developer or
administrator dealing with Java EE applications.
* The link:../agent/osgi.html[OSGi Agent] gets deployed as any other
OSGi bundle, which is also a well known procedure (although
specific to each OSGi container). For the pure bundle, there
is a requirement for an OSGi HttpService implementation
deployed in the OSGi container, but there is also a
all-in-one bundle which embedds all dependencies in a single
bundle. The pure bundle is the prefered agent, though, since
it fits the OSGi philosophy better.
* The link:../agent/jvm.html[JVM JDK 11 Agent] requires for its setup
some extra command line parameter for the JVM, but this
shouldn't be a big deal either.

On the other hand, setting up JSR-160 connectors are not
that easy as it might appear. There are various kind of
issues like problems when using different JDK versions on
client and server side or exposing the
`PlatformMBeanServer`. On our blog, detailed analysis for
JSR-160 setup for
https://labs.consol.de/blog/jmx4perl/configuring-remote-jmx-access-for-weblogic/[Weblogic,role=externalLink]
and
https://labs.consol.de/blog/jmx4perl/jboss-remote-jmx/[JBoss,role=externalLink] has been posted.

Once the agent has been installed, using Jolokia on the client
side is easy. Since the protocol relies on a standard protocol (HTTP)
and format (JSON), it is easy for non-Java systems to access
MBeans. It can be even accessed from within the browser with a
simple URL. Although this is still a bit cryptic, it is a good
test to check the installation of Jolokia.

Assuming that the agent is reachable under
https://localhost:8080/jolokia, memory usage can
be checked with the browser:

The actual value is contained in the returned JSON
representation under the key `value`. In this
example, a so called _path_ (i.e. `used`)
is appended to the URL which allows for deep access in more
complex Java types (`CompositeData` in this
case).
