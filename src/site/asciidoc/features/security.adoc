== JMX Proxy

image:../images/features/secure_large.png["Security",role=right]
Security in Jolokia is provided at two levels: The transport
channel (HTTP) is secured the standard way as it is defined in
the Jakarta EE specifications. The agent itself can be configured to
use a very fine grained policy which can restrict access on
the MBean level for various parameters.

In especially, the policy can restrict access to:

* certain client host IPs or subnets
* certain Jolokia operations (read, exec, list, search, notification)
* specific MBean attributes (read and write) and operations

The security definitions support a wildcard notation and
allow/deny sections similar to the security setup of an Apache
HTTP-Server.

=== Example

The following example shows a sample policy file:

[source,xml]
----
<restrict>

  <remote>
    <host>127.0.0.1</host>
    <host>localhost</host>
    <host>10.0.0.0/16</host>
  </remote>

  <cors>
    <allow-origin>https://www.jmx4perl.org</allow-origin>
    <allow-origin>*.jolokia.org</allow-origin>
  </cors>

  <commands>
    <command>read</command>
    <command>write</command>
  </commands>

  <allow>
    <mbean>
      <name>java.lang:type=Memory</name>
      <attribute mode="read">Verbose</attribute>
      <operation>gc</operation>
    </mbean>

    <mbean>
      <name>jolokia:type=Config</name>
      <operation>*</operation>
    </mbean>
    <mbean>
      <name>java.lang:type=Threading</name>
      <operation>findDeadlockedThreads</operation>
    </mbean>
  </allow>

  <deny>
    <mbean>
      <name>com.mchange.v2.c3p0:type=PooledDataSource,*</name>
      <attribute>properties</attribute>
    </mbean>
    <mbean>
      <name>jdk.management.jfr:type=FlightRecorder</name>
      <attribute>*</attribute>
      <operation>*</operation>
    </mbean>
  </deny>

</restrict>
----

This sample policy contains a ist of remote hosts which are
allowed to access this agent. The name can be given as IP or
FQDN. A  subnetmask can be given, too, for specifying a subnet
for the access. The netmask can be given either in CIDR format
(e.g "/16") or as a full netmask (e.g. "/255.255.0.0").

The address to check is obtained from:

* in WAR agent: `jakarta.servlet.ServletRequest.getRemoteHost()` or `jakarta.servlet.ServletRequest.getRemoteAddr()` depending on `allowDnsReverseLookup` configuration option
* in JVM agent: `com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpExchange.getRemoteAddress()`

The list of allowed commands, which are given in
`<commands>` section determine which Jolokia
operations are allowed in general.  For each command type
present, the principle behaviour is allow this command for all
MBeans. To remove an MBean (attribute/operation), a `<deny>`
section has to be added.  For each command type missing, the
command is disabled by default. For certain MBeans it can be
selectively be enabled by using an `<allow>`
section below. Within the allow and deny sections, MBean names
and attribute/operation names can be specified with a pattern
using wildcards (`?`,`*`)
