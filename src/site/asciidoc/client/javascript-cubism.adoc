== Jolokia-Cubism Integration

https://square.github.com/cubism/[Cubism,role=externalLink] is a
fine JavaScript library for plotting timeseries data based on
https://d3js.org/[d3.js]. It provides support for
various backend sources like
https://graphite.wikidot.com/[Graphite,role=externalLink] or
https://square.github.com/cube/[Cube,role=externalLink] and also for
Jolokia. It is easy to use and provides innovative chart types
like a
https://vis.berkeley.edu/papers/horizon/[horizon,role=externalLink]
chart. The Jolokia integration polls the Jolokia agent
periodically and remembers the values locally. It uses the
link:../reference/html/clients.html#js-poller[scheduling
facility] of the Jolokia JavaScript library by sending a
single bulk request for fetching the data for all charts and is
hence very efficient.

The following sections show some simple real time demos of
this integration. After that, some concepts are explained. The
full JavaScript source can be downloaded
link:../js/javascript-cubism.js[here].

=== HeapMemory

The following demo directly queries Jolokia's
https://labs.consol.de/jenkins[CI,role=externalLink] which
is a plain Tomcat 7. The memory charts show the heap memory
usage as a fraction of the maximum available heap. Note that
different colors indicate different value ranges in this
https://github.com/square/cubism/wiki/Horizon[horizon
chart]. The activity of the two garbage collectors for
the young and old generation are shown below. Feel free to
trigger a garbage collection on your own by pressing the
button and look how the chart is changing.

<div id="memory"></div>
<button style="margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 25px;" onclick="gc()">Trigger Garbage Collection</button>
++++

=== Requests (per 10 seconds)

The second demo visualizes the number of requests served by
this Tomcat instance. The requests are grouped by 10s, so
the values are the number of requests received in the last
10 seconds. The green charts show the requests for the
https://jolokia.org/jolokia[Jolokia agent] and the
href="https://labs.consol.de/jenkins[Jenkins  CI server]. Since this demo queries the Jolokia
agent every second, the first chart should show up at least
10 request per 10 seconds. Finally the number of requests
served by all deployed servlets is drawn in blue.

=== Examples

Plotting the result of a single Jolokia request is simple
and follows the general pattern used by Cubism. You first
create a Jolokia source from the Cubism context and create
metrics from this source. When a metric is created, it
registers one or more Jolokia request for the
link:../reference/html/clients.html#js-poller[Jolokia scheduler]

[source,javascript]
----
// Create a top-level Cubism Context
var context = cubism.context();

// Create a source for Jolokia metrics pointing to the agent
// at 'https://jolokia.org/jolokia'
var jolokia = context.jolokia("https://jolokia.org/jolokia");

// Create a metric for the absolute Heap memory usage
var memoryAbs = jolokia.metric({
    type: 'read',
    mbean: 'java.lang:type=Memory',
    attribute: 'HeapMemoryUsage',
    path: 'used'
    }, "HeapMemory Usage");

// Use d3 to attach the metrics with a specific graph type
// ('horizon' in this case) to the document
d3.select("#charts").call(function(div) {
    div.append("div")
        .data([memoryAbs])
        .call(context.horizon())
});
----

The following example present an advanced concept if more
flexibility is required. When the first argument to
`jolokia.metric()` is a function, this function is
feed periodically with Jolokia response objects resulting from the
requests object given as second argument. The final
argument can be an options object, which in this case indicates
the label of the chart and the type to be a delta chart,
measuring only the increase rate for ten seconds.

This sample also shows how to use wildcard patterns in a read
request to fetch multiple values at once in a generic
fashion. Wildcard reading is explained in detail in the
link:../reference/html/protocol.html#read[reference manual].

[source,javascript]
----
var allRequestsMetric = jolokia.metric(
    function (resp) {
        var attrs = resp.value;
        var sum = 0;
        for (var key in attrs) {
            sum += attrs[key].requestCount;
        }
        return sum;
    },
    {
        type: "read",
        mbean: "Catalina:j2eeType=Servlet,*",
        attribute: "requestCount"
    },
    {
        name: "All Requests",
        delta: 10 * 1000
    });
