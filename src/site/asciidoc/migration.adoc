== Migration

_draft_

* Switch from `javax.servlet` to `jakarta.servlet` (JavaEE/JakartaEE 8 â†’ JakartaEE 9+)
* `jolokia:type=Config` MBean is now registered with `agent=agentId` ObjectName property.
* `roo-addon` is no longer available
* OSGi code registers `org.jolokia.server.core.osgi.OsgiAgentServlet` using Whiteboard Specification instead of Http Service specification
* `listenForHttpService` option is replaced (with deprecation) with `registerWhiteboardServlet` option
* list artifact IDs and their usage

=== JavaScript Client

* The minimum supported JavaScript version is now ES5. For environments with ES3 and older JavaScript versions, keep using old versions of the JavaScript client provided with Jolokia 1.x.
* Since it is based on ES5, `JSON2.js` is no longer required.
* Now it also supports installation with NPM or Yarn. You can install it with `npm i jolokia.js` or `yarn add jolokia.js`.
* You can also use it with a TypeScript project, as the client provides its type definitions with the package.
