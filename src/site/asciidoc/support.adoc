Jolokia is free software, released under the business friendly
Apache License. That's mostly because I believe that open
source software is the real driving force behind software
innovation and I highly appreciate the fine pieces of open
source software engineering I had the luck to use in my daily
work. I love this.

Nevertheless, if you want to support the development of
Jolokia (it is still a hobby project) and you like this
software you can https://www.flattr.com[flattr,role=externalLink] it.
