=== Jolokia 2.5.0 released

[.news-date]
2026-02-10

We're happy to announce a new big release of Jolokia 2.5.0!

==== A word on Semantic Versioning

First - a little apology for breaking https://semver.org/[Semantic Versioning] principles. Jolokia 2.4 and now 2.5 introduced some API
changes related to refactoring and introduction of SPI interface for Jolokia Client (with 3 built-in implementations).

Jolokia is not a single library - it includes:

* Agent modules - for running Jolokia Agent as a Web Application in a https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/6.1/jakarta-servlet-spec-6.1[Servlet Container], https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/3.5/reference/actuator/endpoints.html[Spring Boot Actuator endpoint] or standalone Agent using https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/jdk.httpserver/module-summary.html[JDK HTTP Server].
* Java Client libraries - for accessing the Agent using HTTP Client libraries (now - 3 different implementations)
* JavaScript NPM packages - for accessing the Agent using JavaScript
* https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.management/javax/management/remote/JMXConnector.html[JMX Connector (Client)] implementation
* A Jolokia protocol specification (format of JSON messages) with own versioning scheme

Traditionally Jolokia didn't change the major version too often and we've decided to continue this tradition. +
Indeed, Jolokia Client API has changed, but the migration should be straightforward (just change `J4p` to `Jolokia` prefix for several client-related classes). The main reason for the change was the introduction of SPI interface (`org.jolokia.client.spi.HttpClientSpi`) and removing direct dependency on https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.5.x/index.html[Apache HttpClient 4] API.

==== Module reorganization

Jolokia 2.4.0 introduced new Jolokia Client based on SPI interface and discoverable implementations. This change is combined with a refactoring of _serialization mechanisms_. Before Jolokia 2.4.0, we had three different mechanisms:

* Server (Agent) code was using the _best_ (de)serialization for all required complex data structures (based on Open Types from JMX)
* Jolokia Client was used simplified serialization (object to JSON) mechanism for setting MBean attributes and invoking MBean operations
* JMX Adapter (https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.management/javax/management/remote/JMXConnector.html[JMX Connector (Client)] implementation) was using simplified deserialization mechanism for building Java object from JSON data retrieved using Jolokia Client

Jolokia 2.5.0 removes this difference and now a single, unified (de)serialization mechanism is used in all these areas. This allows use to use Jolokia JMX Adapter with more complex MBeans like Java Flight Recorder.

A new `org.jolokia:jolokia-core` module is introduced - it contains common utilities (escaping, serialization, logging) to be reused throughout other Jolokia modules.

==== Open Types discovery

https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.management/javax/management/MXBean.html[MXBean Specification] has clear, strict, but very flexible rules for Java object representation using _Open Types_. +
In Jolokia 2.5.0 we can use the `list` operation to retrieve actual structure of the complex Open Types used by M(X)Bean attributes and operations.

A picture is worth 1000 words, so here are the attributes for `java.lang:type=Memory` MBean before 2.5.0:

[,json]
----
{
  "request": {
    "path": "java.lang/type=Memory/attr",
    "type": "list"
  },
  "value": {
    ...
    "HeapMemoryUsage": {
      "r": true,
      "rw": false,
      "w": false,
      "is": false,
      "type": "javax.management.openmbean.CompositeData",
      "desc": "HeapMemoryUsage"
    },
    "NonHeapMemoryUsage": {
      "r": true,
      "rw": false,
      "w": false,
      "is": false,
      "type": "javax.management.openmbean.CompositeData",
      "desc": "NonHeapMemoryUsage"
    },
    ...
  },
  "status": 200,
  "timestamp": 1770722333
}
----

And here's what we get with Jolokia 2.5.0:

[,json]
----
{
  "request": {
    "path": "java.lang/type=Memory/attr",
    "type": "list"
  },
  "value": {
    ...
    "HeapMemoryUsage": {
      "r": true,
      "rw": false,
      "w": false,
      "is": false,
      "type": "javax.management.openmbean.CompositeData",
      "desc": "HeapMemoryUsage",
      "openType": {
        "kind": "composite",
        "type": "java.lang.management.MemoryUsage",
        "class": "javax.management.openmbean.CompositeData",
        "items": {
          "init": "java.lang.Long",
          "committed": "java.lang.Long",
          "max": "java.lang.Long",
          "used": "java.lang.Long"
        },
        "desc": "java.lang.management.MemoryUsage"
      }
    },
    ...
  },
  "status": 200,
  "timestamp": 1770722390
}
----

==== JMX Adaptor improvements

We've reviewed entire code for https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.management/javax/management/remote/JMXConnector.html[JMX Connector (Client)] implementation. +
Unified (de)serialization mechanism is now used in this module. With additional information on the Open Types used by the MBeans, Jolokia works much better with tools like JConsole.

Additionally we've introduced a declarative way of configuring the Jolokia Client used by Jolokia JMX Adaptor. When using JConsole with Jolokia, we can easily configure TLS support using system properties or environment variables.

For example we can run `jconsole` with this command line:
[,shell]
----
$ JOLOKIA_CLIENT_KEY_PASSWORD=jolokia \
    jconsole \
    -J-Dswing.defaultlaf=javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel \
    -J-Dsun.java2d.uiScale=3 \
    -J-Djava.class.path=$HOME/.m2/repository/org/jolokia/jolokia-client-jmx-adapter/2.5.0/jolokia-client-jmx-adapter-2.5.0-standalone.jar \
    -J-Djolokia.caCertificate=ca.cer.pem \
    -J-Djolokia.clientCertificate=client.cer.pem \
    -J-Djolokia.clientKey=client-private.key-pk8.pem
----

Certificates and private keys (DER or PEM format, encrypted or plain) can be used without a need to build Java keystores.

==== Improved exception handling

We've reviewed exception handling code. All errors caused by malformed using input (invalid JSON, unknown processing parameters) cause HTTP 400 error (`Bad Request`). +
All JMX errors (except security issues) cause Jolokia error which include an actual JMX exception - so we can better implement the `javax.management.MBeanServerConnection` contract.

==== Spring Boot 4 / Spring Framework 7 support

Due to https://spring.io/blog/2025/10/28/modularizing-spring-boot[Spring Boot 4 modularization effort], we had to alter the way Jolokia is registered as an actuator endpoint. We didn't stop supporting Spring Boot 3, but we now include two separate modules:

* `org.jolokia:jolokia-support-springboot3` - for legacy Spring Boot 3 support
* `org.jolokia:jolokia-support-springboot` - for Spring Boot 4 (and hopefully next versions)

Before Jolokia 2.5.0 we had only one `org.jolokia:jolokia-support-spring` module. And again, breaking (a bit) Semantic Versioning principles, we've renamed the module to highlight that it's actually for Spring Boot (and not only for Spring Framework).

==== Documentation improvements

And last, but not least, we've finally reviewed the documentation updating chapters about Jolokia Client, serialization, the Jolokia protocol and others.

Refer to https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.5.0[changelog] and https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/releases/tag/v2.5.0[GitHub release notes] for more details.

=== Jolokia 2.4.2 released

[.news-date]
2025-10-28

We're announcing a new tiny micro release of Jolokia 2.4.2. This release fixes
one specific scenario where multiple MBean attributes are fetched and there's a security
interceptor (at `MBeanServer` level) involved. +
This is the only change in the new micro release of Jolokia 2.4.2.

(Documentation still has to wait a bit... Hopefully not that long.)

Refer to https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.4.2[changelog] and https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/releases/tag/v2.4.2[GitHub release notes] for more details.

=== Jolokia 2.4.1 released

[.news-date]
2025-10-28

After releasing Jolokia 2.4.0, we've identified a single issue with Artemis server detector. This issue breaks cache
optimization with Jolokia being part of https://hawt.io[Hawtio Console] in https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis[Apache ActiveMQ Artemis] (thanks https://github.com/jbertram[Justin Bertram]!). +
This is the only change in the new micro release of Jolokia 2.4.1.

(Documentation still has to wait a bit...)

Refer to https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.4.1[changelog] and https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/releases/tag/v2.4.1[GitHub release notes] for more details.

=== Jolokia 2.4.0 released

[.news-date]
2025-10-17

Why not 2.3.1? Because there's much more changes than initially planned!

There was https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/issues/565[an issue] created even before the release of Jolokia 2.0 suggesting
that we could move away from https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.5.x/index.html[HttpClient 4] and use
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpClient.html[JDK HTTP Client] instead. Back then, last HttpClient 4
release was already 1 year old and no new releases were published since then. +
New Jolokia version is 2.4.0 mainly because we did it - Jolokia now supports JDK HTTP Client!

But it's not all - JDK HTTP Client support required some API changes, so we took the opportunity to introduce an SPI
for the implementation and we now support *three*, discoverable implementations:

* https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpClient.html[JDK HTTP Client]
* https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.5.x/index.html[HttpClient 4]
* https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.5.x/index.html[HttpClient 5]

Along the HTTP Client changes we've reviewed some (very) old issues related to Jolokia operations - consistently
handling path arguments and response conversion for all supported operation (read, write, exec, search, ...).

New minor release comes after https://blogs.oracle.com/java/post/the-arrival-of-java-25[the release new new Java 25 LTS version].
It is about time to move to JDK 17 as a baseline - welcome `if (value instanceof JSONObject map)`!

Big https://jolokia.org/reference/html/manual/index.html[reference documentation] changes are coming soon after this release.

Refer to https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.4.0[changelog] and https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/releases/tag/v2.4.0[GitHub release notes] for more details.

=== Jolokia 2.3.0 released

[.news-date]
2025-08-01

New minor Jolokia version is released with both new and old technologies.

Jolokia 2.1.0 introduced two _extension points_:

* `org.jolokia.service.jmx.api.CacheKeyProvider` for runtime-specific optimization of `list()` response
* `org.jolokia.service.jmx.handler.list.DataUpdater` for runtime-specific decoration of MBean information (for example RBAC data)

Jolokia 2.3.0 improves internal support for detecting https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/[Apache Artemis] runtime, so experimental (not yet released) extensions work with two supported RBAC mechanisms in Apache Artemis.

Jolokia is also experimenting in the field of AI and https://modelcontextprotocol.io/overview[Model Context Protocol]. https://github.com/tadayosi[Tadayoshi Sato] is working on https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia-mcp-server/[Jolokia MCP Server] and exposing MBeans for LLM usage. +
While Jolokia MCP Server is not yet fully released, Jolokia itself provides now some improvements, like in-VM access to Jolokia server.

We've also reviewed some old technologies. OSGi is back! Because Pax Web 11 was recently released with full support of Servlet API 5+ and https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/8.1.0/service.servlet.html[OSGi CMPN Whiteboard Specification for Jakarta™ Servlet] Jolokia 2.3.0 now officially works with new Whiteboard implementations (both https://github.com/ops4j/org.ops4j.pax.web[Pax Web] and https://github.com/apache/felix-dev/tree/master/http[Felix HTTP]). +
We've also improved OSGi Configuration Admin support, so not Jolokia can be updated dynamically when `org.jolokia.osgi` PID changes.

Refer to https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.3.0[changelog] and https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/releases/tag/v2.3.0[GitHub release notes] for more details.

=== Jolokia 2.2.9 released

[.news-date]
2025-04-28

We'd like to announce a new micro release of Jolokia, where `org.jolokia.server.core.service.api.Restrictor` instances can be registered using Spring (Boot) `@Bean` definitions. With simple declaration of:

[,java]
----
@Bean
public Restrictor customRestrictor() {
    return new CustomReestrictor(...);
}
----

Jolokia servlet registered as Spring actuator endpoint will use your custom restrictor.

Refer to https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.2.9[changelog] and https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/releases/tag/v2.2.9[GitHub release notes] for more details.

=== Jolokia 2.2.8 released

[.news-date]
2025-04-04

New Jolokia release focuses on deployment with https://camel.apache.org/manual/camel-jbang.html#_using_jolokia_and_hawtio[Camel JBang]. We've fixed a deployment scenario where Jolokia was available from multiple classloaders (main one and Hawtio WAR). Jolokia 2.2.8 should work correctly with upcoming Hawtio 4.4 and Camel JBang.

Refer to https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.2.8[changelog] and https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/releases/tag/v2.2.8[GitHub release notes] for more details.

=== Jolokia 2.2.7 released

[.news-date]
2025-03-24

New micro release of Jolokia 2.2.7 comes with `lazy=true` option for JVM agent. Up until now, JVM agent started, but
was initialized only on first HTTP request. This prevented immediate UDP discovery of the agent. Now this option
defaults to `false`, but we can set it back to `true`.

Additionally we run https://www.zaproxy.org/[Zed Attack Proxy scanner] on https://hawt.io/[Hawtio] web application and we could prevent some alerts reported by this tool.

Refer to https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.2.7[changelog] and https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/releases/tag/v2.2.7[GitHub release notes] for more details.

=== Jolokia 2.2.5 and 2.2.6 released

[.news-date]
2025-03-10

We're announcing new micro release of Jolokia 2.2.6, where `org.jolokia:jolokia-support-spring` module no longer depends on `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-logging`. Thanks Benjamin Graf for spotting this issue!
We've also found problems with Spring Boot options:

* server.servlet.context-path - context path for _main_ Spring context
* management.server.base-path - context path for _management_ Spring context (when it's separate from _main_ one)
* spring.mvc.servlet.path - dispatcher servlet prefix for _main_ context
* management.endpoints.web.base-path - Actuator prefix
* management.endpoints.web.path-mapping - for additional customization of Endpoint -> URI path mapping

Now, whatever combination of these options is used, Jolokia will register correct actuator endpoint and use correct Agent URL in `version` response.

Refer to https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.2.6[changelog] and https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/releases/tag/v2.2.6[GitHub release notes] for more details.

=== Jolokia 2.2.4 released

[.news-date]
2025-03-05

Few days after release 2.2.3, we're releasing version 2.2.4 with single change related to Spring Boot Jolokia actuator. It is no longer _active_ in _JMX exposure_. While Jolokia is all about JMX, it is about adapting JMX protocol with JSON/HTTP. We're clarifying usage of `@ConditionalOnAvailableEndpoint` annotation.

Refer to https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.2.4[changelog] and https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/releases/tag/v2.2.4[GitHub release notes] for more details.

=== Jolokia 2.2.3 released

[.news-date]
2025-03-03

We're happy to announce Jolokia micro release 2.2.3.

We've switched from https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.3-Release-Notes#deprecations-in-spring-boot-330[deprecated Spring Boot API for registering endpoints] to `@WebEndpoint` API, so we're ready for newer Spring Boot versions (this deprecated API is going to be removed in Spring Boot 3.5).

Part of maintenance and review work, we've clarified usage of HTTP response codes. As https://jolokia.org/reference/html/manual/jolokia_protocol.html#responses[the reference documentation states], Jolokia responses have two kinds of return codes - HTTP response status and Jolokia response status. With Jolokia 2.2.3 we treat _all_ non-JMX errors as _global_ errors, which result in HTTP status different than 200. The important aspect of this change is that both JSON parsing error and request parameter (from URI) handling errors end with HTTP 400 status ("Bad Request").

Refer to https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.2.3[changelog] and https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/releases/tag/v2.2.3[GitHub release notes] for more details.

=== Jolokia 2.2.2 released

[.news-date]
2025-02-05

New micro release of Jolokia 2.2.2 fixes slow startup time on Mac OS system and restores previous Java client behavior related to numeric value conversion to Java.

Refer to https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.2.2[changelog] and https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/releases/tag/v2.2.2[GitHub release notes] for more details.

=== Jolokia 2.2.1 released

[.news-date]
2025-01-23

We're happy to release Jolokia 2.2.1! This is new minor release, as the scope of changes is a bit too wide for just 2.1.3 release.

In this release we've reviewed support for IPv6 in every place where IP addresses are used - UDP Multicast based discovery, policy restrictor for source IP addresses and URL usage. Jolokia now works properly with UDP/IP6 discovery using an option like `multicastGroup=ff08::48:84,multicastPort=24884` (the default is still `239.192.48.84`).

Spring Boot dependency of `jolokia-support-spring` module has been changed to 3.4.1, but that's only declared dependency. Jolokia works well with all Spring Boot 3 versions.

One of the requested features was restarting Jolokia HTTP server when a change in configured TLS certificates was detected - this is especially important in Kubernetes/OpenShift deployments where the environment may use aggressive certificate refresh policy. Now there's no need to restart entire pod when `useCertificateReload` is set to a given number of seconds. It defaults to `-1` to keep backward compatibility.

And the biggest change is improved configuration management. All options can use property placeholders like:

* `${sys:configurationOption}` (or `${prop:configurationOption}`) to reference system properties
* `${env:VARIABLE_NAME}` to reference environment variables
* `$\{ip}`, `$\{ip6}`, `$\{host}`, `${ip:<interface>}` (e.g., `${ip:eth0}`) to reference networking configuration

Also, similarly to https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/external-config.html[Spring Boot configuration], Jolokia looks up configuration options in different sources/locations (in order of increasing priority - later sources override previous ones):

1. defaults from the code
2. defaults from `default-jolokia-agent.properties` resource of JVM Agent
3. options from file specified by `config` option of JVM Agent
4. environment variables with `JOLOKIA_` prefix
5. system properties with `jolokia.` prefix
6. servlet config parameters
7. servlet context parameters
8. remaining options of JVM Agent (command line)

With this release, current version of `jolokia.js` npm package is 2.2.1 - even if it doesn't bring any changes.

What happened to version 2.2.0? Just after release https://github.com/dornimaug[Klaus Dorninger] found a problem with IPv4 only deployments (thanks for quick check!). So we needed 2.2.1...

Refer to https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.2.1[changelog] for detailed information about the release.

=== Jolokia 2.1.2 released

[.news-date]
2024-11-13

Jolokia 2.1.2 is released and it is ready for more generic integration with other runtimes, especially with https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/[Apache Artemis,role=externalLink,window=_blank].

Long existing `ServerDetector` abstraction was enhanced to let Jolokia know about actual ClassLoader used within given runtime. For example, https://tomcat.apache.org/[Apache Tomcat] starts with just few JARs on system CLASSPATH and later the _actual_ ClassLoader is constructed using JARs from `${catalina.home}/lib`. Now Jolokia running as JVM agent has proper access to classes from this broader ClassLoader.

Additionally we've provided a little diagnostic check to detect (usually incorrect) setup when Jolokia is running twice in single JVM (for example as WAR and JVM agent).

With this release, current version of `jolokia.js` npm package is 2.1.8.

Refer to https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.1.2[changelog] for detailed information about the release.

=== Jolokia 2.1.1 released

[.news-date]
2024-09-12

Jolokia 2.1.1 is released with adjustments to TypeScript type definitions and few improvements to new JavaScript ESM client.
With this release, current version of `jolokia.js` npm package is 2.1.7.

=== Jolokia 2.1.0 released

[.news-date]
2024-08-12

We're happy to announce a new minor release of Jolokia! Minor releases introduce new features and may require a few adjustments to client code. But no worries - the client code needs some adjustments _only_ for the new Jolokia JavaScript library!

==== New JavaScript libraries

After nine (!) years since the introduction of https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/08/es6-in-depth-modules/[ES6 modules] into JavaScript language, we've finally moved JavaScript code from manually created UMD-structured JavaScript files (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function#using_an_immediately_invoked_function_expression_iife[IIFE], https://github.com/umdjs/umd[UMD], https://github.com/myshov/history-of-javascript/tree/master/4_evolution_of_js_modularity[The Evolution of JavaScript Modularity]).

Because nowadays JavaScript "scripts" are consumed using packages, Jolokia provides a new Maven module (`org.jolokia:jolokia-client-javascript-esm`) that contains modern JS packages:

* `jolokia.js`— While this package is already present in https://www.npmjs.com/package/jolokia.js, it now contains different targets—a proper ES module and ready-to-use files produced by https://rollupjs.org/[Rollup JS bundler].
* `@jolokia.js/simple` - this package replaces `jolokia-simple.js` file which was part of initial NPM package.

What's more, the new JavaScript library is developed using the https://www.typescriptlang.org/[TypeScript] language without affecting end-user experience. We now have the full definition of the types used by Jolokia, which has already proved to be very useful in finding miscellaneous problems hidden in type-less JavaScript code.

==== Fetch API

Since Jolokia was created, https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/[JQuery Ajax] performed HTTP calls from JavaScript code. +
Instead of relying on external dependency, we use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API[Fetch API], which is now standard in all modern, secure browsers. +
This makes the Jolokia JavaScript library independent of any external dependency. It also makes the code aware of the async/await programming model and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises[Promises API]. See the dedicated chapter in the link:https://jolokia.org/reference/html/manual/clients.html#client-javascript[reference documentation].

==== New JSON parser

Since https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/commit/4d7a089e97576836945983ecfbbc92ae818b50ac[first available GitHub commit], Jolokia was using `com.googlecode.json-simple:json-simple` JSON parser/serializer library. This library has quite an interesting history (moving from https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/[code.google.com] to GitHub, forking, ...). It does its job very well, but we've decided to make a bold move and remove this dependency without adding a new external JSON dependency.

Here's what we did - we used https://github.com/fangyidong/json-simple/blob/tag_release_1_1_1/doc/json.lex[JSON grammar used by `json-simple`], checked the https://github.com/cliftonlabs/json-simple/blob/json-simple-4.0.1/src/main/lex/jsonstrict.lex[changes made in forked version] and used https://www.jflex.de/[JFlex] to generate Jolokia own lexer. +
With a working lexer, we've built our flexible parser/serializer to fulfill Jolokia's needs. And yes, we've made it ~2x faster (in non-exhaustive tests involving https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/[Artemis broker] running with 10,000 queues).

The new Jolokia module is `org.jolokia:jolokia-json` and it fully replaces `com.googlecode.json-simple:json-simple` library. Class names are the same, the only change is in the package name (switch from `org.json.simple` to `org.jolokia.json`).

==== New Jolokia protocol version

Going with the flow, after moving from JavaScript to TypeScript and getting our own JSON parser, we've introduced a new Jolokia protocol version, `8.0`. There's more information in the link:https://jolokia.org/reference/html/manual/jolokia_protocol.html#optimized-response-list[relevant documentation section], but here's a summary of the changes:

* With the new `listKeys` processing/request parameter, `list()` operation returns an additional `"keys"` field for MBean's MBeanInfo - it contains a map of the keys obtained from ObjectName
* With the new `includeRequest` processing/request parameter, we can tell Jolokia not to return incoming requests under the `"request"` field of the response (defaults to `true`)
* The `list()` operation may be optimized with the new `listCache` processing/request parameter. It allows caching the common JSON representation of MBeanInfo to avoid duplicating it in the `list()` response for, say, 50,000 Artemis queue MBeans. Getting 2MB instead of 0.5GB of JSON is always a good thing. More details can be found in the documentation.

==== New extension points

To make `list()` operation more flexible (based on experience gained from the https://hawt.io/[Hawtio console]), Jolokia now provides extension points for `list()`. While it is still based on `javax.management.MBeanServerConnection.queryMBeans()` call, we don't necessarily blindly serialize each MBean's `javax.management.MBeanInfo`.

In detail, Jolokia offers these new extension hooks:

* With the `org.jolokia.service.jmx.api.CacheKeyProvider` Jolokia service, we can ask third-party libraries whether a given MBean can be translated into a _cache key_. If many MBeans can be translated into a single cache key, we can optimize the `list()` response by caching common MBeanInfo.
* with the `org.jolokia.service.jmx.handler.list.DataUpdater` Jolokia service, we can get additional information inside JSON representation of `javax.management.MBeanInfo` - 3rd party extensions may add RBAC information or any other data into the MBeanInfo

==== Old issues resolved

It's worth noting that we've also fixed issues dating back up to 2015...

* Added support for custom date format for dates (and new `java.time` classes)
* Added support for multi-dimensional arrays
* Added support for `java.util.Date` operation parameters
* Added ability to declare (in `jolokia-access.xml`) that some MBeans simply should not be returned in `search` and `list` operations.

=== Jolokia 2.0.3 released

[.news-date]
2024-06-06

Jolokia 2.0.3 is released with 3 minor fixes. Certificate chains are handled better (thanks https://github.com/shayelkin[Shay Elkin]!) and we know allow to configure how `long` values are handled during JSON serialization.

Refer to https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.0.3[changelog] for detailed information about the release.

=== Jolokia 2.0.2 released

[.news-date]
2024-03-07

Spring time is approaching and we've skimmed through some old issues to clean them up. Jolokia 2.0.2 is released with few minor fixes. Most notably, write-only JMX attributes are now handled correctly and heuristic Jolokia shutdown thread is replaced with proper https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Runtime.html#addShutdownHook(java.lang.Thread)[JVM shutdown hook].

We've also ensured that all tests pass on IBM versions of JDK.

Refer to https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.0.2[changelog] for detailed information about the release.

=== Jolokia 2.0.1 released

[.news-date]
2024-01-26

Following the big 2.0.0 release last year, we continue to improve Jolokia by clearing the backlog and adding new features and improvements.

With 2.0.1 release we're fixing custom log handler configuration. We also integrate better with https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/3.2.2/reference/html/actuator.html#actuator.endpoints.enabling[Spring Boot Actuator] by handling `management.endpoint.jolokia.enabled` property.

As always, please refer to https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.0.1[changelog] for more details.

=== Jolokia 2.0 arrives: A new chapter begins!

[.news-date]
2023-12-19

image::images/jolokia2-presents.png[role="right"]

We are excited to announce the long-awaited release of Jolokia 2.0, now available in https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/jolokia/[Maven Central,role=externalLink,window=_blank].

This release is a result of our dedicated effort in reviewing, restructuring, refactoring, and polishing. Here's what Jolokia 2.0 brings to the table:

* Support for JakartaEE 9+ (Servlet API 5+ with `jakarta.servlet` packages)
* Enhanced connectivity with JMX notifications
* Integration with Spring Boot 3 and Spring Framework 6
* A fresh, pluggable service-based architecture
* A revamped and user-friendly link:https://jolokia.org/reference/html/index.html[Reference Manual] powered by Antora
* JDK 11 is the minimal version of JDK required. Spring related Jolokia modules require JDK 17. (No worries, we're still supporting Jolokia 1.x with minimal version of JDK 1.6 supported).

And that's not all. We're already planning more frequent updates, including exciting new features like websockets and IPv6 support.

Jolokia 2 also gears up to seamlessly integrate with the upcoming https://github.com/orgs/hawtio/projects/1[Hawtio 4.0,role=externalLink,window=_blank]!

It should be straightforward to upgrade to new Jolokia 2 in JVM agent mode. WAR agent users should use any compatible JakartaEE 9+ container. Check out our xref:migration.adoc[Migration to 2.x] guide for more information.

Your support and patience over these years have been incredible. We're grateful for your enduring loyalty. Let's end this year on a high note and step into 2024 with new energy and possibilities!

Warm regards, +
Grzegorz, Tadayoshi, Roland

=== Jolokia has a new home!

[.news-date]
2023-07-13

Yes, finally we moved Jolokia from my (rhuss) personal
account to a dedicated GitHub organisation:
https://github.com/jolokia[https://github.com/jolokia,role=externalLink,window=_blank].
I'm super happy that the story of Jolokia continues and you
will see quite some new faces very soon. Thanks Tadayoshi,
Grzegorz, Aurélien and all the other fine folks from Red Hat
who started to revive Jolokia. Also, Jolokia 2.0 becomes a realistic
option again. Stay tuned!
