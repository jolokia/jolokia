=== Jolokia 2.1.0 released

[.news-date]
2024-08-??

We're happy to announce a new minor release of Jolokia! Minor releases introduce new features and may require a few adjustments to client code. But no worries - the client code needs some adjustments _only_ for the new Jolokia JavaScript library!

==== New JavaScript libraries

After nine (!) years since the introduction of https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/08/es6-in-depth-modules/[ES6 modules] into JavaScript language, we've finally moved JavaScript code from manually created UMD-structured JavaScript files (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function#using_an_immediately_invoked_function_expression_iife[IIFE], https://github.com/umdjs/umd[UMD], https://github.com/myshov/history-of-javascript/tree/master/4_evolution_of_js_modularity[The Evolution of JavaScript Modularity]).

Because nowadays JavaScript "scripts" are consumed using packages, Jolokia provides a new Maven module (`org.jolokia:jolokia-client-javascript-esm`) that contains modern JS packages:

* `jolokia.js`— While this package is already present in https://www.npmjs.com/package/jolokia.js, it now contains different targets—a proper ES module and ready-to-use files produced by https://rollupjs.org/[Rollup JS bundler].
* `@jolokia.js/simple` - this package replaces `jolokia-simple.js` file which was part of initial NPM package.

What's more, the new JavaScript library is developed using the https://www.typescriptlang.org/[TypeScript] language without affecting end-user experience. We now have the full definition of the types used by Jolokia, which has already proved to be very useful in finding miscellaneous problems hidden in type-less JavaScript code.

==== Fetch API

Since Jolokia was created, https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/[JQuery Ajax] performed HTTP calls from JavaScript code. +
Instead of relying on external dependency, we use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API[Fetch API], which is now standard in all modern, secure browsers. +
This makes the Jolokia JavaScript library independent of any external dependency. It also makes the code aware of the async/await programming model and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises[Promises API]. See the dedicated chapter in the link:reference/html/manual/clients.html#client-javascript[reference documentation].

==== New JSON parser

Since https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/commit/4d7a089e97576836945983ecfbbc92ae818b50ac[first available GitHub commit], Jolokia was using `com.googlecode.json-simple:json-simple` JSON parser/serializer library. This library has quite an interesting history (moving from https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/[code.google.com] to GitHub, forking, ...). It does its job very well, but we've decided to make a bold move and remove this dependency without adding a new external JSON dependency.

Here's what we did - we used https://github.com/fangyidong/json-simple/blob/tag_release_1_1_1/doc/json.lex[JSON grammar used by `json-simple`], checked the https://github.com/cliftonlabs/json-simple/blob/json-simple-4.0.1/src/main/lex/jsonstrict.lex[changes made in forked version] and used https://www.jflex.de/[JFlex] to generate Jolokia own lexer. +
With a working lexer, we've built our flexible parser/serializer to fulfill Jolokia's needs. And yes, we've made it ~2x faster (in non-exhaustive tests involving https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/[Artemis broker] running with 10,000 queues).

The new Jolokia module is `org.jolokia:jolokia-json` and it fully replaces `com.googlecode.json-simple:json-simple` library. Class names are the same, the only change is in the package name (switch from `org.json.simple` to `org.jolokia.json`).

==== New Jolokia protocol version

Going with the flow, after moving from JavaScript to TypeScript and getting our own JSON parser, we've introduced a new Jolokia protocol version, `8.0`. There's more information in the link:reference/html/manual/jolokia_protocol.html#optimized-response-list[relevant documentation section], but here's a summary of the changes:

* With the new `listKeys` processing/request parameter, `list()` operation returns an additional `"keys"` field for MBean's MBeanInfo - it contains a map of the keys obtained from ObjectName
* With the new `includeRequest` processing/request parameter, we can tell Jolokia not to return incoming requests under the `"request"` field of the response (defaults to `true`)
* The `list()` operation may be optimized with the new `listCache` processing/request parameter. It allows caching the common JSON-ified MBeanInfo to avoid duplicating it in the `list()` response for, say, 50,000 Artemis queue MBeans. Getting 2MB instead of 0.5GB of JSON is always a good thing. More details can be found in the documentation.

==== New extension points

To make `list()` operation more flexible (based on experience gained from the https://hawt.io/[Hawtio console]), Jolokia now provides extension points for `list()`. While it is still based on `javax.management.MBeanServerConnection.queryMBeans()` call, we don't necessarily blindly serialize each MBean's `javax.management.MBeanInfo`.

In detail, Jolokia offers these new extension hooks:

* With the `org.jolokia.service.jmx.api.CacheKeyProvider` Jolokia service, we can ask third-party libraries whether a given MBean can be translated into a _cache key_. If many MBeans can be translated into a single cache key, we can optimize the `list()` response by caching common MBeanInfo.
* with the `org.jolokia.service.jmx.handler.list.DataUpdater` Jolokia service, we can get additional information inside JSON-ified `javax.management.MBeanInfo` - 3rd party extensions may add RBAC information or any other data into the MBeanInfo

==== Old issues resolved

It's worth noting that we've also fixed issues dating back up to 2015...

* Added support for custom date format for dates (and new `java.time` classes)
* Added support for multi-dimensional arrays
* Added support for `java.util.Date` operation parameters
* Added ability to declare (in `jolokia-access.xml`) that some MBeans simply should not be returned in `search` and `list` operations.

=== Jolokia 2.0.3 released

[.news-date]
2024-06-06

Jolokia 2.0.3 is released with 3 minor fixes. Certificate chains are handled better (thanks https://github.com/shayelkin[Shay Elkin]!) and we know allow to configure how `long` values are handled during JSON serialization.

Refer to https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.0.3[changelog] for detailed information about the release.

=== Jolokia 2.0.2 released

[.news-date]
2024-03-07

Spring time is approaching and we've skimmed through some old issues to clean them up. Jolokia 2.0.2 is released with few minor fixes. Most notably, write-only JMX attributes are now handled correctly and heuristic Jolokia shutdown thread is replaced with proper https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Runtime.html#addShutdownHook(java.lang.Thread)[JVM shutdown hook].

We've also ensured that all tests pass on IBM versions of JDK.

Refer to https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.0.2[changelog] for detailed information about the release.

=== Jolokia 2.0.1 released

[.news-date]
2024-01-26

Following the big 2.0.0 release last year, we continue to improve Jolokia by clearing the backlog and adding new features and improvements.

With 2.0.1 release we're fixing custom log handler configuration. We also integrate better with https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/3.2.2/reference/html/actuator.html#actuator.endpoints.enabling[Spring Boot Actuator] by handling `management.endpoint.jolokia.enabled` property.

As always, please refer to https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.0.1[changelog] for more details.

=== Jolokia 2.0 arrives: A new chapter begins!

[.news-date]
2023-12-19

image::images/jolokia2-presents.png[role="right"]

We are excited to announce the long-awaited release of Jolokia 2.0, now available in https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/jolokia/[Maven Central,role=externalLink,window=_blank].

This release is a result of our dedicated effort in reviewing, restructuring, refactoring, and polishing. Here's what Jolokia 2.0 brings to the table:

* Support for JakartaEE 9+ (Servlet API 5+ with `jakarta.servlet` packages)
* Enhanced connectivity with JMX notifications
* Integration with Spring Boot 3 and Spring Framework 6
* A fresh, pluggable service-based architecture
* A revamped and user-friendly link:reference/html/index.html[Reference Manual] powered by Antora
* JDK 11 is the minimal version of JDK required. Spring related Jolokia modules require JDK 17. (No worries, we're still supporting Jolokia 1.x with minimal version of JDK 1.6 supported).

And that's not all. We're already planning more frequent updates, including exciting new features like websockets and IPv6 support.

Jolokia 2 also gears up to seamlessly integrate with the upcoming https://github.com/orgs/hawtio/projects/1[Hawtio 4.0,role=externalLink,window=_blank]!

It should be straightforward to upgrade to new Jolokia 2 in JVM agent mode. WAR agent users should use any compatible JakartaEE 9+ container. Check out our xref:migration.adoc[Migration to 2.x] guide for more information.

Your support and patience over these years have been incredible. We're grateful for your enduring loyalty. Let's end this year on a high note and step into 2024 with new energy and possibilities!

Warm regards, +
Grzegorz, Tadayoshi, Roland
