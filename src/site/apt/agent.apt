Agents

  Various agents are available for providing Jolokia
  services in different environments:

  * <<WAR Agent>> for deployment as web application in a Java EE Server.

  * <<OSGi Agent>> for deployment in an OSGi container. This
    agent is packaged as a bundle and comes in two flavors (minimal,
    all-in-one).

  * <<JVM Agent>> which can be used with any Oracle/Sun based JVM,
    Version 6 or later.

  * <<Mule Agent>> for usage within a Mule ESB.

* WAR Agent

  The WAR agent <<<jolokia.war>>> deploys as a regular web archive
  (WAR) in a Java EE server. Deployment is simple (often only a copy in a
  certain directory) and the agent can be tuned like a normal web
  application. Setting it up the agent servlet for secure
  communication is a well known business (but specific to every
  application server) and the same as for any other web archive. The
  runtime behaviour like connection pooling or dedicated HTTP
  connector can be tuned very easily (for Tomcat, see this
  {{{http://labs.consol.de/blog/nagios/putting-jmx4perl-on-the-fast-lane-for-tomcat/}example}}
  for setting up an extra HTTP connector for this agent).

  Also, this is the agent for the {{{./features/proxy.html} proxy mode}} where it is
  deployed in a simple, dedicated application server like Tomcat or
  Jetty.

  The WAR agent has been tested to work on

  * JBoss 4.2.3, 5.1.0, 6.1.0, 7.0.2, 7.1.1, 8.0.0

  * Oracle WebLogic 9.2.3.0, 10.0.2.0, 10.3.6.0

  * Glassfish 2.1.1, 3.0.1, 3.1.2, 4.0.0

  * IBM Websphere 6.1.0.33, 7.0.0.11, 8.0.0.1, 8.5

  * Apache Tomcat 5.5.35, 6.0.37, 7.0.52, 8.0.3

  * Jetty 5.1.15, 6.1.26, 7.6.9, 8.1.9, 9.1.2

  * Resin 3.1.9

  * Jonas 4.10.7, 5.1.1, 5.2.1

  * Apache Geronimo 2.1.6, 2.2.1, 3.0.0

  * Spring dm Server 2.0.0.RELEASE

  * Eclipse Virgo 2.1.0

  []

  This is the most widely used agent. Read more about the
  {{{./agent/war.html}WAR agent}} and its installation.

* OSGi Agent

  For an {{{http://www.osgi.org}OSGi}} environment an agent packaged as
  an OSGi bundle is provided. The bundle comes in two flavors: The
  minimal bundle <<<jolokia-osgi.jar>>>, including only the
  agent itself (and an {{{http://code.google.com/p/json-simple/}json-simple}} embedded), which
  requires an already installed {{{http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v42/org/osgi/service/http/HttpService.html}OSGi HTTP service}} like
  the {{{http://wiki.ops4j.org/display/paxweb/Pax+Web}Pax-Web HTTP-Service}}. A second version
  <<<jolokia-osgi-bundle.jar>>> is an all-in-one bundle, including the
  Pax Web HTTP-Service. This bundle is useful for quick installations,
  where no HTTP-Service is already existent. However, for best fitting
  the OSGi philosophy, the usage of the minimal bundle is
  recommended.

  The OSGi agent has been tested with the following containers:

  * Felix 2.0.5, 3.0.8, 3.2.2, 4.2.1

  * Equinox 3.5.2, 3.6.1, 3.7.1, 3.8.1

  * Karaf 2.3.0

  * Virgo 2.1.0, 3.0.1

  * Knopflerfish 3.2.0

  {{{./agent/osgi.html}OSGi agent}} and its installation.

* JVM Agent

  Since Java 5 it is possible to start so called <JVM agents> in
  advance before starting a Java application. This technique is used
  e.g. by profiling tools for installing global classloaders in order
  to instrument classes. Additionally, Sun's Java 6 JVM comes with a
  simple embedded HTTP-Server which is used e.g. for exposing web
  services with the default JAXWS implementation coming with Java 6.

  This Jolokia agent uses the agent API and the <<<HTTPServer>>> to
  allow instrumenting <any> Java application running with a Sun Java 6
  VM, not only application servers.

  The JVM Agent has been tested with:

  * Camel 2.8.1

  * ActiveMQ 5.5.0

  * Hadoop 0.20.2

  * Terracotta 3.2.1

  * HornetQ 2.2.14

  {{{./agent/jvm.html}JVM agent}} and its installation.

* Mule Agent

  The {{{http://www.mulesoft.org}Mule Standalone ESB}} offers a dedicated JMX agent
  interface, into which this agents plugs in seemlessly.

  This agent has been tested for Mule 2 and Mule 3 (3.1.1 and 3.2.0).
