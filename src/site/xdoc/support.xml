          Jolokia uses <a
          href="http://github.com/rhuss/jolokia">GitHub</a> as source
          repository and employs a <a
          href="http://help.github.com/pull-requests/">Fork + Pull
          Model</a> for development. The git clone URL is <code>git@github.com:rhuss/jolokia.git</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are always looking for volunteers to enhance Jolokia. If
          you would like start to participate, we suggest the
          following way:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Check for an open <a
            href="javascript:MyOtziv.mo_show_box();">feature request</a>
            you like or unresolved (and open) <a
            href="http://github.com/rhuss/jolokia/issues">bug</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fork Jolokia by visiting the <a
            href="http://github.com/rhuss/jolokia">project page</a>
            (use "Fork" from the menu). 
          </li>
          <li>
            Leave a short note, on what you are working (so that we
            can update the status of the feature request or bug). 
          </li>
          <li>
            After finishing your implementation, send a <a
            href="http://help.github.com/pull-requests">pull
            request</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            After briefly reviewing the code contribution, it will
            integrated into the master repository.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Please note, that all the contributed code must be

          We occassionally blog on
          <a href="http://labs.consol.de">http://labs.consol.de</a> about various
          topics (1-2 posts per month). There are interesting use cases how to

        <p>
          Thanks to <a href="http://www.consol.de">ConSol*</a>, we are
          able to offer professional support and consulting. I.e. we
          do (and already have done for jmx4perl with quite some
          success):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Support with certain service level agreements, up to 7x24.
          </li>
          <li>
            Workshops for evaluating how to best integrate Jolokia (and 
            <a href="http://www.jmx4perl.org">jmx4perl</a>) in your server
            landscape. We are especially expert for large scale integration in
            large Nagios and OP5 setups, not only for monitoring JMX MBeans
            but for Nagios in general.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consulting and custom programming, e.g. an agent manager for mass
            deployment of the agents to hundreds of servers.
          </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Please contact me (either per mail at roland@jolokia.org or via our
        <a href="http://www.consol.de/">contact form</a>) if you are interested
        in a concrete offering or for a reference.

        So, that was it for the plug ;-)

        <p>
          Jolokia is free software, released under the business friendly
          Apache License. That's mostly because I believe that open
          source software is the real driving force behind software
          innovation and I highly appreciate the fine pieces of open
          source software engineering I had the luck to use in our daily
          work. I love this.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should probably stop reading here at this
          point ;-)
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, there's a way for financially supporting this
          project. I have been asked for this possibility. Donations
          will help keeping up the movivation for further enhancements
          of Jolokia (and to honor the past development which took some
          efforts). The motivation is high anywayh, though.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two way: Either via a direct donation with <a href="http://pledgie.com/">Pledgie</a>
          or via <a href="http://www.flattr.com">Flattr</a>, which is
          a real new revolutionary way of
          give-and-take and much fun, too. Enough said, here are the buttons:
        </p>
        <div align="center">
          <div style="float:right; margin: 30px 150px 50px 100px;">
            <a href='http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/13618'
               style="background: none; padding: 0"><img

            border='0' /></a>
          </div>
          <div style="float:right; margin-right: 50px; margin-top: 20px;">
           <a class="FlattrButton" style="display:none;"
