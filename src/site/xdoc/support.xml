        obtained. Bugs are tracked via <a
        href="http://github.com/rhuss/jolokia/issues">GitHub</a>,
        questions should be preferably posed in the Jolokia <a

          Jolokia uses <a
          href="http://github.com/rhuss/jolokia">GitHub</a> as source
          repository and employs a <a
          href="http://help.github.com/pull-requests/">Fork + Pull
          Model</a> for development. The git clone URL is <code>git@github.com:rhuss/jolokia.git</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are always looking for volunteers to enhance Jolokia. If
          you would like start to participate, we suggest the
          following way:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Check for an open feature request
            you like or open bug at <a
            href="http://github.com/rhuss/jolokia/issues">GitHub</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fork Jolokia by visiting the <a
            href="http://github.com/rhuss/jolokia">project page</a>
            (use "Fork" from the menu). 
          </li>
          <li>
            Leave a short note, on what you are working (so that we
            can update the status of the feature request or bug). 
          </li>
          <li>
            After finishing your implementation, send a <a
            href="http://help.github.com/pull-requests">pull
            request</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            After briefly reviewing the code contribution, it will
            integrated into the master repository.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Please note, that all the contributed code must be
          licensable under <a href="license.html">Apache License</a>,
          Version 2.

        <p>
          We occassionally blog on
          <a href="http://labs.consol.de">http://labs.consol.de</a> about various
          topics (1-2 posts per month). There are interesting use cases how to
          setup JSR-160 connectors for <a
          href="http://labs.consol.de/blog/jmx4perl/jboss-remote-jmx/">JBoss</a> 
          and <a
          href="http://labs.consol.de/blog/jmx4perl/configuring-remote-jmx-access-for-weblogic/">Weblogic</a>,
          what is the best way 
          for configuring <a

          with check_jmx4perl</a> but also

        <p>
          Thanks to <a href="http://www.consol.de">ConSol*</a>, we are
          able to offer professional support and consulting. I.e. we
          do (and already have done for jmx4perl with quite some
          success):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Support with certain service level agreements, up to 7x24.
          </li>
          <li>
            Workshops for evaluating how to best integrate Jolokia (and 
            <a href="http://www.jmx4perl.org">jmx4perl</a>) in your server
            landscape. We are especially experts for large scale integration in
            huge Nagios and OP5 setups, not only for monitoring JMX MBeans
            but for Nagios in general.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consulting and custom programming, e.g. an agent manager for mass
            deployment of the agents to hundreds of servers.
          </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Please contact me (either per mail at roland@jolokia.org or via our
        <a href="http://www.consol.de/">contact form</a>) if you are interested
        in a concrete offering or for a reference.

        So, that was it for the plug ;-)

        <p>
          Jolokia is free software, released under the business friendly
          Apache License. That's mostly because I believe that open
          source software is the real driving force behind software
          innovation and I highly appreciate the fine pieces of open
          source software engineering I had the luck to use in my daily
          work. I love this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, if you want to support the development of
          Jolokia (it is still a hobby project) and you like this
          software you can <a href="http://www.flattr.com">flattr</a> it.
