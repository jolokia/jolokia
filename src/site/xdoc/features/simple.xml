        For Jolokia to work, an agent must be deployed, the one way or
        the other. But this is a common business:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <a href="../agent/war.html">WAR Agent</a> gets deployed as any other
          Java EE web application. Often this is as simpe as a simple
          copy of the agent war-artifact into a certain directory
          (like for Tomcat). Or it gets deployed via an administrative
          user interface (web GUI or command line tool). In any case,
          the procedure should be familar to any Java developer or
          administrator dealing with Java EE applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <a href="../agent/osgi.html">OSGi Agent</a> gets deployed as any other
          OSGi bundle, which is also a well known procedure (although
          specific to each OSGi container). For the pure bundle, there
          is a requirement for an OSGi HttpService implementation
          deployed in the OSGi container, but there is also a
          all-in-one bundle which embedds all dependencies in a single
          bundle. The pure bundle is the prefered agent, though, since
          it fits the OSGi philosophy better.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <a href="../agent/mule.html">Mule Agent</a> is a Mule JMX-Agent, whose
          installation is described in detail in the Mule documentation.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <a href="../agent/jvm.html">JVM JDK 6 Agent</a> requires for its setup
          some extra command line parameter for the JVM, but this
          shouldn't be a big deal either.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        On the other hand, setting up JSR-160 connectors are not
        that easy as it might appear. There are various kind of
        issues like problems when using different JDK versions on
        client and server side or exposing the
        <code>PlatformMBeanServer</code>. On our blog, detailed analysis for
        JSR-160 setup for <a
        href="http://labs.consol.de/blog/jmx4perl/configuring-remote-jmx-access-for-weblogic/">Weblogic</a>
        and <a
          href="http://labs.consol.de/blog/jmx4perl/jboss-remote-jmx/">JBoss</a> has been posted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the agent has been installed, using Jolokia on the client
        side is easy. Since the protocol relies on a standard protocol (HTTP)
        and format (JSON), it is easy for non-Java systems to access
        MBeans. It can be even accessed from within the browser with a
        simple URL. Although this is still a bit cryptic, it is a good
        test to check the installation of Jolokia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assuming that the agent is reachable under
        <code>http://localhost:8080/jolokia</code>, memory usage can
        be checked with the browser:
      </p>
      <div align="center">
        <img src="../images/jolokia_browser.png" alt="Browser Snapshot"/>
      </div>
      <p>
        The actual value is contained in the returned JSON
        representation under the key <code>value</code>. In this
        example, a so called <em>path</em> (i.e. <code>used</code>)
        is appended to the URL which allows for deep access in more
        complex Java types (<code>CompositeData</code> in this
        case).
