        Jolokia is an agent based approach for remote JMX access. It
        is an alternative to standard <a
        href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=160">JSR 160</a>
        connectors. The communication between client and agent goes
        over HTTP (either GET or POST), where the request and response
        payload is represented in JSON.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Jolokia protocol supports the following operations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reading and writing JMX attributes</li>
        <li>Execution of JMX operations</li>
        <li>Searching for MBean Names by pattern</li>
        <li>Listing of MBean Meta-data like supported attributes,
        operations and notifications</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Up to now JMX <em>notifications</em> are not supported yet (but
        these are on the roadmap for a future version).
      </p>
      <p>
        Jolokia's overall architecture is shown in the next
        diagram. The agent translates between JSON over HTTP and calls
        to local MBeans, including a JSON serialization of the return
        values.

      <p>
        This approach has some advantages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          With help of the agent Jolokia is able to provide services
          which go beyond the functionality of JSR-160 connectors:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="bulk-requests.html">Bulk requests</a> which
               allow for multiple JMX calls within a single request
            </li>
            <li>
              Fine grained <a href="security.html">security</a> with
              access restriction on MBean operation and attribute
              level.
            </li>
            <li>
              Merging of multiple <code>MBeanServer</code> into one
              virtual view, so there's no need to know in advance
              which MBean is registered on which
              <code>MBeanServer</code>. With JSR-160 the target
              <code>MBeanServer</code> has to be known in advance.
            </li>
            <li>
              History mode for storing previous fetched values in a
              cache on the server side, along with a time stamp. This
              is especially useful to calculate the change of JMX
              attributes without need of a client storage.
            </li>
            <li>
              No Java is required on the <a
              href="polyglot.html">client</a> side due to the platform
              neutral nature of HTTP and JSON.
            </li>
            <li>
              JSON serialization allows for deep access into returned
              objects without having custom type definitions installed
              on the client side.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Since HTTP uses a single predefined port, this setup plays nicely with
          <a href="firewall.html">firewall</a> configuration. The
          JSR-160 default connector in contrast is not that smart
          since RMI uses a random port for its communication by
          default.
        </li>
        <li>
          As paradox as it might sound, setting up an agent is often
          <a href="simple.html">easier</a> than setting up the
          configuration for JSR-160 JMX export, especially when it
          comes to security. Typically, for JSR-160 export startup
          files and configuration of the application server has to be
          adapted. The standard agent gets deployed as a regular
          web-application, which is a well known procedure.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The single disadvantage of this mode is, that an agent has to
        be installed. This might be for policy reasons that no
        external application is allowed to be installed. Or all
        servers to be monitored are already prepared for JSR-160 JMX
        export so an extra installation step is not welcome. Also,
        updating Jolokia normally implies a redeployment of the
        agent. These are all good reasons, for which Jolokia has an
        answer, too. By installing a dedicated Java EE-Server with an
        deployed agent, Jolokia can operate in  <a
        href="proxy.html">proxy mode</a>, in which case it translate
        Jolokia JSON request into JSR-160 client request for operation
        on the target server. Vice versa, the result over a JSR-160
        connector then gets translated into a JSON response which is
        returned to Jolokia client.

      <subsection name="Example">
        <p>
          In order to get a feeling how the Jolokia protocol looks like,
          here is an example of a simple Jolokia request and
          response. Assuming that an <a
          href="../agent.html">agent</a> is installed, the following
          HTTP <code>GET</code>
          request reads the used heap memory statistics of the instrumented JVM:
        </p>
        <pre>
 http://localhost:8080/jolokia/read/java.lang:type=Memory/HeapMemoryUsage</pre>
        <p>
          <code>http://localhost:8080/jolokia</code> is the base URL
          under which the agent is reachable.
          The same request can be done by POSTing the following body
          to the URL <code>http://localhost:8080/jolokia</code>:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
  {
    "mbean":"java.lang:type=Memory",
    "attribute":"HeapMemoryUsage",
    "type":"READ"
  }</pre>
         <p>
           In both cases, the response contains an JSON object:
         </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
  {
    "timestamp":1285531108,
    "status":200,
    "request": {
                 "mbean":"java.lang:type=Memory",
                 "attribute":"HeapMemoryUsage",
                 "type":"read"
               },
     "value": {
                "max":"129957888",
                "committed":"85000192",
                "init":"0",
                "used":"7713440"
              }
  }</pre>
