        All started up early 2009 when my colleague Gerhard Lausser,
        our local Nagios guru and complained heavily about how damned
        hard it is to monitor JEE servers with <a
        href="http://www.nagios.org">Nagios</a>. As you might know,
        Nagios uses a pletoria of plugins for doing the hard
        monitoring stuff. These are running locally on a central
        Nagios host contacting the watched systems mostly remotely
        with various techniques. For Java applications, <a
        href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/core/mntr-mgmt/javamanagement/">JMX</a>
        is of course the the proper choice which provides <a
        href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=160">JSR-160</a>
        connectors remote access to the local MBeans. At this time,
        indeed several JMX Nagios plugins were already
        present. However, they all suffer from the same problem:
        JSR-160 connectors are highly Java centric where its default
        protocol RMI is not available outside the Java universe. So,
        each plugin (which runs in an external process when called by
        Nagios) needs to start up a Java Virtual Machine. This has to
        be done for every check, and since there are usual hundreds of
        checks every five minutes this becomes easily a performance
        and memory bottleneck. Additionally, you need a Java
        installation on the Nagios host, which for many administrators
        poses a, let's say 'cultural' problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a Java programmer I love JMX. It is one of the oldest Java
        specifications, which was carefully crafted from the very
        beginning (especially the core API). Other Java APIs had to
        take a longer tour until they became widely accepted by the
        masses as not being painful (think "EJB" or "JSF"). However,
        I'm not really happy with JSR-160's focus on Java based remote
        protocols. There has been some efforts to make these more
        friendly to the outside world (e.g. a <a
        href="https://ws-jmx-connector.dev.java.net/">JSR-160
        WebService connector</a>), but it seems there is not much
        momentum anymore behind these. And frankly, I don't want to
        use WebServices for monitoring, either.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was the birth of <a href="http://www.jmx4perl.org">jmx4perl</a> in May
        2009. Coming from a strong perl background (being a SGI system
        administrator at university in my former life), my initial goal
        was to use pure Perl for accessing remote JMX information without
        the need of a local Java integration.  In turned out that an agent
        based approach was the simplest way. The first agent, a JEE
        webapplication, which on the frontside translates HTTP requests with
        a REST payload to local JMX calls (and vice versa for the response),
        was really lightweight. It knew how to read and set attributes and
        how to execute operations. It had a list mode for looking up all
        registered MBeans. And it was
        <a href="http://labs.consol.de/maven/repository/org/jmx4perl/j4p-agent/0.16/j4p-agent-0.16.war">38kb</a> in size.
      </p>
      <p>
        The jmx4perl agent is now ~ 150kb 'large' with many more
        features (search, bulk requests, security, ....) but I still call it
        lighweight ;-). The perl part consists now of a powerful
        Nagios plugin called <a
        href="http://search.cpan.org/~roland/jmx4perl/scripts/check_jmx4perl">check_jmx4perl</a>,
        a command line tool called <a
        href="http://search.cpan.org/~roland/jmx4perl/scripts/jmx4perl">jmx4perl</a>,
        a Perl library named <a
        href="http://search.cpan.org/~roland/jmx4perl/lib/JMX/Jmx4Perl.pm">JMX::Jmx4Perl</a>
        and a readline based (with context sensitive tab completion on
        MBean names) JMX shell called <a
        href="http://search.cpan.org/~roland/jmx4perl/scripts/j4psh">j4psh</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the feedback I got, it seems that the Nagios world is happy
        now. But since I think that this agent based approach provides also a
        good alternative to JSR-160 connectors for other platforms, it is
        time to move on and split the Java and Perl part of jmx4perl into two
        separate projects. The number of programmers who love both Java
        and Perl is negligible anyway ;-). The Perl part (which is
        approximately the same size as the Java part) remains jmx4perl,
        the agent part has become ... Jolokia.

    <section name='Why it is named "Jolokia" ?'>
      <p>
        Jolokia is the world most hottest chili with a Scoville rating
        of at most <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale#List_of_Scoville_ratings">1,075,000</a>. I'm
        a chili head and grow chilis since 2006. I love 
        chilis as much as JMX. That's the main reason reason.
      </p>
      <p>        
        The other is, that a chili is a good metaphore for a hot, new
        approach for JMX remoting. Especially when it is the hottest
        one ;-)
