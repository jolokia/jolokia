      <strong>Jolokia</strong> is remote JMX with JSON over HTTP.<br/>

      Jolokia is a JMX-HTTP bridge giving an alternative to JSR-160
      connectors.  It is an agent based approach with support for many
      platforms. In addition to basic JMX operations it enhances JMX
      remoting with unique features like bulk requests or fine grained
      security policies.

        <p>
          We will be hanging around in Antwerp at the very fine <a
          href="http://www.devoxx.com">Devoxx</a> from 15th to 19th
          November. Leave me a mail at roland@jolokia.org or follow us
          on Twitter (<a
          href="http://www.twitter.com/jolokia_jmx">@jolokia_jmx</a>)
          if you are interested in Jolokia's current state and its
          future roadmap. Or if you simply want to go for a beer and
          have some JMX talk ;-)

        <p>
          Finally, <a href="index.html">www.jolokia.org</a> has
          arrived. It provides many pieces of useful information about
          Jolokia, but is not completely finished yet. The <a
          href="reference/html/index.html">reference manual</a> needs
          still some work as well as some other pages.  Hopefully you
          enjoy it nevertheless. <a href="forum.html">Feedback</a> is
          highly appreciated.

          <em>Release soon, release often</em>. That's what they told
          me.

      <subsection name="Jolokia 0.80 released">
        <div class="news-date">2010-10-17</div>
        <p>
          The first version of Jolokia has been released. Version 0.80
          can be obtained from the <a
          href="./download.html">Download</a> page and from our maven
          repository. This version is identical to the agent part of
          <a
          href="http://search.cpan.org/~roland/jmx4perl-0.72/">jmx4perl
          0.72</a>, feature- and codewise. Future versions of jmx4perl
          will be packaged without agent but with a dependency on
          Jolokia.
