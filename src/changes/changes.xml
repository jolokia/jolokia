        Introduced new configuration parameter "logHandlerClass" which can be used to specify an alternate
        LogHandler for the WAR and JVM agent. Also, if the JVM agent is used programmatically, a LogHandler
        instance can be provided during construction time.

        The authenticator for the JVM Agent can now be specified via the configuration in order
        to provide a custom authenticator which goes beyond simple BasicAuthentication.

      <action dev="roland" type="fix" issue="105" date="2013-05-05">
        Conversion for TabularData optimized. If any index of an TabularData
        structure is not a SimpleType, then a direct serialization of the Tabular
        Data (i.e. an JSON Object with two entries "indexNames" and "values" is created).
        Otherwise, if it is the representation of an MXBean Map attribute, the map is recreated,
        otherwise, nested maps are used for simple acces. More on this in the
        reference manual.

      <action dev="roland" type="add" date="2013-02-21">
        Added enums for serialization/deserialization. It's really surprising how long
        this missing feature slipped without anybody missing it ;-)
      </action>
      <action dev="roland" type="fix" date="2013-02-20" issue="66">
        Added additional query parameters (serializeException, canonicalNaming and includeStackTrace)

        Fixed URI encoding for GET requests in the JavaScript client library.
      </action>
      <action dev="roland" type="fix" date="2013-02-11">
        Added safety net for serialization, so that OutputStreams and Writers are never
        obtained from get-methods if they declare a subclass as return value. It happens e.g. for
        Jetty 8.1 that FileResource.getOutputStream() opens a new FileOutputStream nuking the
        existing data. Nice side effect ;-)
      </action>
      <action dev="roland" type="fix" date="2013-02-07" issue="59">
        Added new global and process configuration options "includeStackTrace" (true,false,runtime)

        Fixed Glassfish detector which failed to boot AMX in certain circumstances.
      </action>
      <action dev="roland" type="add" date="2013-01-27">
        Added support for JSON-MBean. A dedicated @JsonMBean annotation can be used
        to export complex arguments/attributes/return values as JSON String to the Platform
        MBeanServer. Jolokia now offers an own MBeanServer as well for registering MBeans which
        won't show up in any other (exported) MBeanServer (except for the delegation of @JsonMBeans
        which are delegated and translated).
      </action>
      <action dev="roland" type="fix" date="2013-01-13">
        Fixed issues with GET requests and MBean ObjectNames which end with a "/".

        Fixed timestamp in the Java client library's response.

      <action dev="roland" type="add" date="2012-12-30">
        New module "jolokia-spring" with Spring integration for the
        JVM agent has been added. It contains an own Spring
        configuration syntax and provides also a plugin for automatic
        startup the agent with default values by only declaring a
        dependency (works for containers which automatically lookup
        META-INF/spring/*.xml). Kudos to James Strachan for the
        initial idea.

      <action dev="roland" type="fix" date="2012-07-27">
        Jolokia JVM agent used with startup options now initializes

        proper server detection.
      </action>
      <action dev="mikael,jstrachan,roland" type="add" date="2012-10-10">
        One can now change the key property order for MBeans names with the query parameter "canonicalNaming" 
        for read, list and search operations. By default this is set to "true" in which case
        an alphabetical ordering for the keys is used. If set to "false", then the original name as registered
        is used. 
      </action>
      <action dev="roland" type="add" date="2012-11-23">
        Added a method "jobs()" to the JavaScript Jolokia agent to get all handles for all currently registered
        jobs.

      <action dev="matejj" type="add" date="2012-07-19" issue="JOL-35">
        Added a deserialization to javax.management.ObjectName so that attributes of

      </action>
      <action dev="roland" type="add" date="2012-06-12">
        Added specific check for 7.1.x to JBoss Handler since for 7.1 there seems

      <action dev="roland" type="add" date="2012-06-06">
        Allow for custom detector options in the agent's
        configuration. These options can be evaluated during startup
        of the agent. The first (and only) option it 'bootAmx' for
        allowing a Glassfish detector to not boot up the AMX subsystem
        upon start of this agent. By default (since it is probably
        needed every time when Jolokia is installed), AMX is booted to
        provide the most userful information over JMX.
      </action>
      <action dev="roland" type="add" date="2012-06-05">

        If registering of an ConfigMBean doesnt work because there has been already one be
        registered with the same name by another agent, a warning is giving out and a UUID is adde to
        the object name, so startup works as usual. Use either a "mbeanQualifier" or an "httpServiceFilter" in
        order to avoid naming collisions from the very beginning.
      </action>
      <action dev="roland" type="add" date="2012-04-09" issue="JOL-27">

        Support for upstream serialization of open type,

        Fixed date handling when an MBean exports an attribute as
        date. It is now returned as an ISO-8601 formatted string, when
        used with a path "time" the epoch milliseconds are
        returned. Setting of date values and using dates as arguments
        for JMX operations is now also supported, the value can be
        given either in epoch milliseconds or as an ISO-86-1 formatted
        string. With a path "time" a given date value can be even
        updated for a write operation.

        Reworked "list" handling. It's now much faster when used with
        paths since it doesn't slurp in the whole meta and truncate
        it afterwards but does the right thing directly to only fetch
        the required information. The list handler respect now a
        'maxDepth' request option for truncating the data from top
        down. 'maxDepth' works with paths, too. Comprehensive unit
        tests has been added as well.
