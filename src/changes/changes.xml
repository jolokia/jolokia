        Allow for custom detector options in the agent's
        configuration. These options can be evaluated during startup
        of the agent. The first (and only) option it 'bootAmx' for
        allowing a Glassfish detector to not boot up the AMX subsystem
        upon start of this agent. By default (since it is probably
        needed every time when Jolokia is installed), AMX is booted to
        provide the most userful information over JMX.

        If registering of an ConfigMBean doesnt work because there has been already one be
        registered with the same name by another agent, a warning is giving out and a UUID is adde to
        the object name, so startup works as usual. Use either a "mbeanQualifier" or an "httpServiceFilter" in
        order to avoid naming collisions from the very beginning.

        Jolokia's Java client library now can request MBeans via an

        Added support for global and request procession parameter

        Added a dynamical attach mode for the JVM agent launcher (patch
        by Greg Bowyer).  The agent now includes also a client for
        dynamically starting/stoping an agent on already running Java
        process. See the reference manual for more information.

      <action dev="roland" type="add" date="2011-8-7">
        Support for upstream serialization of open type,
        i.e. CompositeData and TabularData.  This allows for easy
        access to MXBeans, which provide support of transparent
        translation between plain Java objects and collections, which
        follow some restrictions, to open type data. Jolokia knows how
        to deal with the fixed format used by this MXBean translation
        of Maps and transparentrly dispatch this to a JSON
        map. Initial patch provided by asssaf.

      <action dev="roland" type="add" date="2011-04-23">
        Added HTTPS support for the JVM agent. In order to switch
        it on, the property "protocol=https" must be set and
        additional the properties "keystore" and "keystorePassword"
        for pointing to the keystore which holds the server side
        certificate. Client side certificate authentication is
        switched off currently alway.
      </action>
      <action dev="roland" type="fix" date="2011-04-18">
        Fixed date handling when an MBean exports an attribute as
        date. It is now returned as an ISO-8601 formatted string, when
        used with a path "time" the epoch milliseconds are
        returned. Setting of date values and using dates as arguments
        for JMX operations is now also supported, the value can be
        given either in epoch milliseconds or as an ISO-86-1 formatted
        string. With a path "time" a given date value can be even
        updated for a write operation.
      </action>
      <action dev="roland" type="update" date="2011-04-14">
        Reworked "list" handling. It's now much faster when used with
        pathes since it doesn't slurp in the whole meta and truncate
        it afterwards but does the right thing directly to only fetch
        the required information. The list handler respect now a
        'maxDepth' request option for truncating the data from top
        down. 'maxDepth' works with pathes, too. Comprehensive unit
        tests has been added as well.

      <action dev="roland" type="add" date="2011-04-04">

        A search request will now return an empty list, not an error
