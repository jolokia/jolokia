= Jolokia Core/Common/Utils/Converter library

This module contains code common to server and client Jolokia modules.
Before this module, sophisticated conversion and serialization was part of `jolokia-service-serializer` module used by Agent modules. +
Jolokia client was using simplified conversion.

This module contains:

* Basic API (LogHandler)
* Common utils
* Crypto support and simple ASN.1/DER parser
* Object to Object converter
* Object to `OpenType` (simple, array, composite, tabular) converter
* Object to JSON converter

All these foundation converters are used by Jolokia client and `JolokiaSerializer` service now.
