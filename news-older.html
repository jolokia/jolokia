<p>Yes, finally we moved Jolokia from my (rhuss) personal
account to a dedicated GitHub organisation:
<a href="https://github.com/jolokia" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/jolokia</a>.
I&#8217;m super happy that the story of Jolokia continues and you
will see quite some new faces very soon. Thanks Tadayoshi,
Grzegorz, Aur√©lien and all the other fine folks from Red Hat
who started to revive Jolokia. Also, Jolokia 2.0 becomes a realistic
option again. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>2021-07-26</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jolokia took a big nap during the last two years. That&#8217;s especially true for me, and I apologize to all of the
excellent contributors who still keep Jolokia alive. The reason for the silence was really that my work
interested has completely shifted. Jolokia is now older than ten years, and I think it aged quite well. But it
gets harder and harder for me to justify working on Jolokia (and yes, I promised a 2.0 for ages, all the work
is more or less done, but it would be irresponsible to move it out without being able to support it ;-(
So, before we come to the fantastic new features if you are a Jolokia fan and willing to keep it alive, reach
out to me. To be honest, if no one else steps up to take over the helm, Jolokia will very likely be sunset end
of this year. It just feels not very good to constantly apologize for being so slow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Said that now to the amazing features that have been contributed over the last two years:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Great news: Jolokia now has an actual JSR-160 connector that allows you to connect jconsole and another
JSR-160 aware tooling to directly connect to Jolokia. Also, you can use the connector to connect into a
Kubernetes cluster directly.

<p>2019-06-20</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This summer version 1.6.2 comes with support for multiple CAs when running the Jolokia agent in SSL mode. This
is especially useful when used together with newer versions of OpenShift.</p>

<div class="paragraph news-date">
<p>2019-05-01</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1.6.1 is coming quite late although many of its features are available since quite some time. Apologies for
that, it was a busy time for me (but not so much for Jolokia).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This release contains one relevant security check which hardens the CORS handling a bit further. Additional
some minor goodies are added, please check the <a href="changes-report.html">changelog</a> for details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, what&#8217;s next? Jolokia is currently not close to the top of my priority list at the moment. It won&#8217;t be, and
I will work on security fixes promptly when reported. However, the most important update to Java 9 as well the
release of Jolokia 2.0 with JMX notification support is currently put on ice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Said that it&#8217;s currently a perfect moment to jump in to boost Jolokia development. We&#8217;ve got the <a href="https://github.com/jolokia/" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jolokia</a> donated, so one of the next larger moves would move this personal pet project to a more solid foundation.
If you are interested in helping shaping Jolokia 2.0 which is then ready for Java 9 and support for monitoring
platforms like Prometheus, then let&#8217;s talk.</p>

<p>In any case, enjoy the summer. Happy hacking ;-)</p>

<h3 id="war_agent_secured_by_default_in_1_6_0">WAR-Agent secured by default in 1.6.0</h3>
<div class="paragraph news-date">
<p>2018-06-25</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As <a href="https://matmannion.com/jolokiapwn/"" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> by security consultant Mat Mannion, there is a massive set of Jolokia agents reachable unsecured from the Internet.
While its obviously not recommended to run Jolokia unsecured or even expose it publicly, authentication is enabled now by default in <code>jolokia.war</code>. So in order to continue to the <a href="agent/war.html">WAR-agent</a> you have to setup
your servlet&#8217;s container authentication to associate enabled users with the role <code>jolokia</code> (like by adding it
to <code>tomcat-users.xml</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For quick experiments or when you insist somehow to avoid authentication, then you can use the newly added
<a href="https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/jolokia/jolokia-war-unsecured/1.6.0/" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jolokia-unsecured.war</a>.
Of course you are still free to mangle the <code>web.xml</code> within either war agent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That said, I still recommend the <a href="reference/html/manual/agents.html#agents-jvm" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JAR agent</a>
over the WAR agent for most cases, as it has much more flexible security options, included HTTPS encryption
with client certificate authentication.
See the <a href="reference/html/manual/agents.html#agents-jvm" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reference manual</a> for all
security options.</p>

<h3 id="security_fixes_with_1_5_0">Security fixes with 1.5.0</h3>
<div class="paragraph news-date">
<p>2018-02-08</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two security issues for Jolokia have recently been discovered by Olga Barinova of
<a href="https://www.gdssecurity.com/" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gotham Digital Science</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Jolokia <a href="reference/html/manual/proxy_mode.html" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JMX proxy mode</a> is vulnerable
to remote code execution in a specific scenario. Note that this only affects the
<a href="reference/html/manual/agents.html#agents-war" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WAR agent</a>, which
has the proxy mode enabled by default.
The <a href="reference/html/manual/agents.html#agents-jvm" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JVM agent</a> is not affected as it
does not support the JMX proxy mode</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An XSS attack can be performed by manipulating the <code>mimeType</code> query parameter to coerce the Web
browser to display the JSON response directly. However, we consider the impact quite low, as Jolokia responses are
<em>not</em> shown directly in the browser but used by a JavaScript library, which has to perform its own escaping of
user provided response data. Jolokia 1.5.0 fixes this hole nevertheless.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jolokia 1.5.0 now fixes these issue in the following way:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a first measure, the JMX proxy mode is <strong>disabled by default</strong> for the WAR agent.
You can switch it on if you need as usual by adding the relevant configuration to <code>web.xml</code>.
But you can now also enable the proxy mode without touching <code>jolokia.war</code>:
By setting a Java system property or an environment variable, the proxy mode
can be switched on again, too.
These parameters can be easily added to the startup script of your servlet container.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, you can now configure a whitelist with allowed patterns for the JMX service URL used as
the target URL of the proxy.
These patterns are supposed to be contained in a plain text file, line by line.
Pattern matching is performed case insensitive.
This file then can be referenced by a system property, an env variable or directly configured in
<code>web.xml</code>
in the war file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the configuration options of the Jolokia proxy please refer to
the <a href="reference/html/manual/proxy_mode.html" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proxy Mode</a> section of the reference manual.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we always recommend using a dedicated server when using the JMX proxy mode, e.g. a Jetty or Tomcat
servlet container.
These servers should be protected by requiring some authentication. The authentication setup is specific to
the
Java EE server but you have to edit the Jolokia WAR agent to enable authentication as described in the
<a href="reference/html/manual/agents.html#agent-war-security" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Security Setup</a> chapter in the reference manual.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For closing the XSS vulnerability, nothing extra needs to be configured.
Jolokia now just verifies that only <code>text/plain</code> and <code>application/json</code> is allowed as
the
value of the query parameter <code>mimeType</code> and falls back to plain <code>text/plain</code> if
something
different is provided.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is <strong>highly recommended</strong> to upgrade to Jolokia 1.5.0 if you are relying on the <strong>JMX
JSR-160 proxy</strong> feature and to
revisit your security setup around the proxy server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Big Kudos go out to GDS (and especially to Olga Barinova and Martin Hopkins) for openly reporting these issues
in deep
detail to me and being very cooperative in helping to fix these. Also to R3, for whom GDS was working when
these issues
were discovered, who encouraged GDS to report them. Highly appreciated!</p>

<p>Removed internal class <code>ChunkedWriter</code> which accidentally includes parts of the internal Java class <code>StreamEncoder</code></p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even when the minor bug fixes or feature changes might not make you considering an upgrade, the last point
is important. The Jolokia version from 1.3.4 to 1.3.7 included a class <code>ChunkedWriter</code> which in
turn included some parts of the Java internal class <code>StreamEncoder</code>, which is released under the
GPL. As you might know Jolokia is released under the APL which is not compatible to the GPL. The affected
class has been removed so everything is clean again (to the best of my knowledge).</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wow, already April and half a year after the last release. Yes, it has been calm around Jolokia the last
time. It&#8217;s not because it lost its relevance, it&#8217;s just because things are as they are. As much as I would
love to progress faster, other exciting projects are eating up my time massively. Luckily Jolokia 1.x is
really
stable these days and used in a lot of products as their major monitoring interface. And as much I would love
to
finally kick off 2.0, there does not seem too much demand for it yet ;-(. Which is also a good thing as it
proves
that Jolokia 1.x is still absolutely sufficient for day to day needs. And it&#8217;s even so that Jolokia stays even
more
relevant as <a href="https://ro14nd.de/java-management-is-dead" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Java EE Management</a> (JSR-373) will never
come.
Of course, as times goes by, alternative monitoring interfaces for Java (like to
<a href="https://prometheus.io/" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prometheus</a>)
gain in importance. But as long JMX has some meaning for monitoring in the Java world, Jolokia is here to
stay.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, what&#8217;s new in 1.3.6 ?</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/issues/258" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annoying issue</a> with the Jolokia agent when
running
under Wildfly and Wildfly Swarm has been tackled
and solved. It was a bit tricky because of the special way how wildfly loads classes which makes it hard
for any agent based approach to work within. Please try it, if there are still any issues with Wildfly
based system, <a href="https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/issues/new" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">let us know</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>list</code> command now adds the class name of the MBean to the list of meta data returned.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although Jolokia 2 is not here yet, it&#8217;s not dead. Branch 2.0 is fully rebase on the 1.3 line and the 2.0.0
milestone
releases are still recommended support for notifications is required. It&#8217;s quite stable, just not yet
released.
For Jolokia 1.x I don&#8217;t expect any revolutionary changes in 2017, so you probably can expect a next 1.3.7
release
in autumn, collecting all the bug fixes on the way.</p>

<p>We are getting closer. I&#8217;m happy to announce that the first
milestone release 2.0.0-M1 is out and available from Maven central.
Of course, it is highly experimental. The main new features are JMX notification support
(pull and SSE mode) and refactorings leading to an internal modularization (which
you will see when looking into WAR agent).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I would be more than happy if you would try out the

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was quite calm around Jolokia this summer and not much
happened in Jolokia-land. Not many bugs arrived, too,
which I take as a good sign :)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now let&#8217;s start a next round with some revamped TLS support
for https connections. Version 1.3.2 introduces a handful of
new options for advanced configuration of the JVM agent&#8217;s
TLS connector:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the keystore (option
<code>keystore</code>) the CA and the server cert as well
as the server cert&#8217;s key can be provided as PEM
files with the options <code>caCert</code>,
<code>serverCert</code>
and <code>serverKey</code>,
respectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Client cert validation has also be enhanced. In addition to
validating the CA signature of a client cert, one can now
also check that the <em>extended key usage</em> block of the cert
was created for client usage (option
<code>extendedClientCheck</code>). Also, one or more
principals can be configured with
<code>clientPrincipal</code>
which are also compared againt
the subject within a client certificate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For simple use cases where no server validation is required,
Jolokia is now able to create self-signed server
certificates on the fly. This happens if neither a keystore
nor a server PEM cert is provided. So, the easiest way to
enable https is simply to add
<code>protocol=https</code>. Of course, the client needs to
disable cert validation then and it is recommended to use
basic-authentication to authenticate the connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The changes affect the <a href="agent/jvm.html">JVM agent</a> only
and are explained in the
<a href="reference/html/manual/agents.html#agents-jvm" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reference manual</a>.</p>

<p>After quite some winter sleep Jolokia is back with a fresh
release. This is mostly a <a href="changes-report.html">bug fix release</a> with some new features:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A simple <code>MBeanPlugin</code> hook for registering own MBeans with the agent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for OSGi&#8217;s ConfigAdmin Service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New possibility to hook into the deserialization process for responses in the Java client</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proxy can be specified for the Java client</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Constructor based deserialization of Strings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for Mule 3.6.1</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is one important change in the default behaviour of the WAR agent: Up to 1.2.3 Jolokia truncates any
collection in the response value at
a threshold of 1000 elements by default. This limit can be overwritten
permanently in the configuration or per request as query parameter
(<code>maxCollectionSize</code>). However, it turned out that this limit was <a href="https://github.com/hawtio/hawtio/issues/1725" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not large enough</a>. So the new default behaviour is to have <strong>no limit</strong> at
all. As said, if you need it you always can set a hard limit in the
agent&#8217;s configuration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But the biggest news is probably something complete different: I&#8217;m
super happy to announce that I (roland) joined Red Hat since May, where I will
able to continue to work on Jolokia with an even higher
intensity. Before looking into the future, acknowledgements go to my
former employer <a href="https://www.consol.com" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ConSol</a>. Without the support donated by ConSol Jolokia

probably never has been grown from the original personal pet project to a full

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s welcome Jolokia&#8217;s next minor release which is not
<em>so</em>
minor as it might seems.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Custom authenticator support for the Java client. The
standard authenticator allows preemptive authentication now
as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for "*" wildcard in paths. See below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally an update to json-simple-1.1.1 which is mavenized,
but still has its issues and not much traction to fix
it. No problem we have a good workaround and it is still
rock solid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bug fixes. Yep.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The biggest new feature with the most impact is path
wildcard support. You probably know <a href="reference/html/manual/jolokia_protocol.html#read">pattern read
requests</a> which allow for fetching multiple patterns by
using patterns for MBean names and attributes (not to be
confused with <a href="reference/html/manual/jolokia_protocol.html#post-request">bulk
requests</a>). When using pattern read requests, the value
in the returned JSON structure is not a single return value
for an attribute but a more complex structure containing the
full MBean names and attributes which are matched by the
pattern. Of course, it is not easy to use a path to navigate
on this structure, the path has to know the full
MBean name (well, why using a pattern then ?). That&#8217;s the main
reason why path access was not supported for pattern read
requests up to release 1.2.1</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Starting with 1.2.2 it is possible to use "*" wildcards in
patterns, which match a complete 'level' in the JSON
object. This makes it easy to fetch all same-named
attributes on arbitrary MBeans and extract only parts of
their values. In fact, it is not so easy explain wildcard
pathes, but here is a try (another try can be found in the <a href="reference/html/manual/jolokia_protocol.html#read">reference manual</a>):</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If using a literal path, then everything works as expected:
The value the path points to is returned. Mostly this is a
scalar value because that is what paths was introduced for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the path contains a single "*" as a part, then when
coming to <em>this level</em> everything is included. A
path containing a wildcard cannot be a scalar anymore, but
is a JSON object or array. The remaining path parts are
included as described above to each element at this level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A path can contain multiple wildcards, but wildcards can
be used only on its own. If a "*" is used as part of a
path part (like <code>current*</code>), it&#8217;s taken literally (which
most of the time doesn&#8217;t make much sense). This might
change in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The net effect is, that literal path parts are "squeezed"
(i.e. removed) in the resulting answer, whereas wildcard
parts stay as extra levels.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You see, wildcard path handling is somewhat complex. For
pattern read request they make quite some sense, for all
other requests, I couldn&#8217;t find good use cases yet. Please
open an issue if any suspicious behaviour during
path-wildcard using occurs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, I would also like to mention a new GitHub project
<a href="https://github.com/rhuss/jolokia-extra" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jolokia-extra</a>
which holds additional goodies. One design goal of Jolokia
is to keep it focused. That&#8217;s not so easy as there are tons
of ideas out there, all backed by a particular use case. And
they all want to get into the game. Beside that someone has
to implement that (hint: still looking for contributions ;-), I
opened a new playground for all that stuff which might not
be of general interest but are still pearls. That&#8217;s what
<code>jolokia-extra</code>
is for.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The beginning makes a 1.5 year old <a href="https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/pull/50" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pull request</a> from <a href="https://github.com/mplonka" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marcin P≈Çonka</a>
(Thanks a lot and sorry for the long, long delay,
BTW). It&#8217;s all about simplifying access to JSR-77 enabled
Java EE-Servers. You should know that <a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=77" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JSR 77: J2EE Management</a> was a cool attempt to standardize naming and
JMX exposed metrics for Java EE. Unfortunately it was abandoned,
but still lives in quite a bunch of Java EE servers. Not at its
full beauty, but still valuable enough to be
supported. Astonishingly, WebSphere, even the latest 8.5
versions, has the best support for it. Using JSR-77 conform
MBeans with plain Jolokia returns unnecessarily complex JSON
structures which are hard to parse and
understand. <code>jolokia-extra</code> adds a set of
simplifier for make the usage with JSR-77 simpler (but add
an extra of 50k to the agent). I recommend to have a look at it,
especially if you are working with WebSphere.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the future, it might be the case, that some lesser used
additions (Spring and Spring Roo integration, JBoss Forge
support, &#8230;&#8203;) will go into <code>jolokia-extra</code> as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enough blubber, enjoy this release. And just in case, if
anybody is wondering about 2.0 (BTW, is there
<strong>anyone</strong>
out there carrying about this next
generation JMX transcended super-hero ?), just drop a note

<p>This minor release fixes some bugs and brings some <a href="changes-report.html">smaller features</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>An ActiveMQ server detector has been added</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Java client library has been updated to the latest Apache HTTP components 4.x.
If you are forced to still use Apache HTTP Client 3.x, you still can use the Java Client Lib from
Jolokia 1.2.0 which will work with a Jolokia agent 1.2.1 nicely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bug fix for JBoss 4.2.3 (yeah, seems still to be used)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cleaned up logging for discovery requests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Placeholders can be used when specifying the agent URL which will be used in discovery responses.
That way you can configure the URL flexibly from you server configuration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And finally there is an important addition to the configuration of Jolokia&#8217;s access policy. You might know,
that you can configure CORS so the agent allows access only from certain origins. CORS is used by browsers for
cross origin sharing and is a pure client side check. I.e. the browser asks the server and if the server
says "no" the browser forbids any Ajax request to this server from any script. However, this still allows
non-Ajax requests from any origin. To restrict this, too, a new configuration directive
<code>&lt;strict-checking&gt;</code>
has been added to the <code>&lt;cors&gt;</code> section which, if given, will do also a server-side check of
a <code>Origin:</code> header when provided by the browser. If a security policy is used, it is highly
recommended to
set this flag (which for compatibility reason is switched off by default). And yes, it is of course highly
recommended to use a <a href="reference/html/manual/security.html#security-policy">jolokia-access.xml</a> policy in
production
(and not only for servers exposed to the bad internet directly). This is especially important if you can
access
Jolokia agents directly via a browser which is also used for internet access
(hint: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSRF</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No news about 2.0 ? Yes, indeed. The giant is still sleeping, "Jolokia forever", you know. But the
pressure rises, for some conferences I have some CFPs out which hopefully will lead to some nice CDD sessions
("conference driven development", yeah).</p>

<div class="paragraph news-date">
<p>2014-02-24</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>New year, new release. Ok, it&#8217;s not the BIG 2.0 which I already somewhat promised. Anyways,
another big feature jumped on the 1.x train in the last minute. It is now possible to find agents in your
network by sending
an UDP packet to the multicast group <code>239.192.48.84</code>, port <code>24884</code>. Agents having this discovery mechanism enabled
will respond with their meta data including the access URL. This is especially
useful for clients who want to provide access to agents without much configuration. I.e.
the excellent <a href="https://hawt.io" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hawt.io</a> will probably use it one way or the other. In fact, it was
hawt.io
which put me <a href="https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/pull/126" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on track</a> for this nice little feature ;-)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Discovery is enabled by default for the <a href="reference/html/manual/agents.html#agents-jvm">JVM agent</a>, but not
for
the <a href="reference/html/manual/agents.html#agents-war">WAR agent</a>.
It can be easily enabled for the WAR agent by using servlet init parameters, system properties or environment
variables.
All the nifty details can be found in the <a href="reference/html/manual/index.html">reference manual</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The protocol for the discovery mechanism is also <a href="reference/html/manual/jolokia_protocol.html#discovery">specified</a>
in the reference manual. One of the first clients
supporting this discovery mode is <a href="https://search.cpan.org/~roland/jmx4perl/lib/JMX/Jmx4Perl.pm" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jmx4Perl</a>
in its newest version. The Jolokia
Java client will follow in one of the next minor releases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But you don&#8217;t need client support for multicast requests if you know already the URL for one agent. Each
agent registers a MBean <code>jolokia:type=Discovery</code> which perform the multicast discovery request for
you if you trigger the operation <code>lookupAgents</code>. The returned value contains the agent information
and is described <a href="reference/html/manual/jolokia_mbeans.html#mbean-discovery">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feature has been tested in various environments, but since low level networking can be, well, "painful",
I would
ask you to open an <a href="https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/issues" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue</a> in case of any problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although it has been quiet some time with respect to the shiny new Jolokia 2.0, I&#8217;m quite close to a first
milestone. All planned features has been implemented in an initial version, what&#8217;s missing is to finish the
heavy
refactoring and modularisation of the Jolokia core. More on this later, please stay tuned &#8230;&#8203;</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some bug fixes and two new features has been included for the <a href="changes-report.html">autumn release</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A new configuration parameter <code>authenticatorClass</code> can be used for the JVM agent to specify an
alternate authentication handler in addition to the default one (which simply checks for user and password).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the configuration parameter <code>logHandlerClass</code> an alternative log handler can be specified.
This can
be used for the WAR and JVM agent in order to tweak Jolokia&#8217;s logging behaviour. For the OSGi agent you
already
could use a <code>LogService</code> for customizing logging.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s it and I hope you enjoy this release. I know, I&#8217;m late with 2.0, but as things happens, I have too
much to do in 'real life' (i.e. feeding my family ;-). But I still hope to get it out this year, and yes, the
2.0 branch is growing (slowly).</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This last feature release before work on 2.0.0 starts brings
some small goodies.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>BigDecimal</code> and <code>BigInteger</code> can
now be used for operation arguments and return values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new processing parameter <a href="reference/html/manual/jolokia_protocol.html#processing-parameters"><code>ifModifiedSince</code></a>
has been introduced. This parameter can be used with a
timestamp for fetching the list of available MBeans only
when there has been some changes in the MBean registration
on any observed MBeanServer since that time. If there has
been no changes an answer with status code "302" (Not
modified) is returned. This feature is also supported for
"search" requests. In a future version of Jolokia, there
will be also custom support for own "read" and "exec"
request so that expensive operations can be called
conditionally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the JVM agent, if a port of 0 is given, then an
arbitrary free port will be selected and printed out on
standard output as part of the Jolokia agent URL. If no
host is given, the JVM agent will now bind to localhost
and if host of "0.0.0.0" or "*" is provided, the agent
will bind on all interfaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the Java client an extra property
<code>errorValue</code>
has been added which holds the
JSON serialized exception if the processiong parameter
<code>serializeException</code>
is active.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The JavaScript client&#8217;s <a href="reference/html/manual/clients.html#js-poller"><code>jolokia.register()</code></a>
can now take an optional <code>config</code> element for
specifying processing parameters for a certain scheduler
job. Also, the new option <code>onlyIfModified</code> can
be used so that the callback for list and search request
is only called, if the set of registered MBean has
changed. This is especially useful for web based client
which want to refresh the MBean tree only if there are
changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>Expires:</code> header of a Jolokia response
has now a valid date as value (instead of <code>-1</code>) which
points to one hour in the past. This change should help
clients which do not ignore according to RFC-2616 invalid
date syntax and treat them as 'already expired'.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Links to the corresponding GitHub issues and the bugs fixed
in this release can be found in the <a href="changes-report.html">change report</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the last feature release in the 1.x series. Work has
already started on exciting new features for Jolokia
2.0. E.g. JMX notification support is coming, an initial
pull model has been already implemented (on branch
<a href="https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/tree/notification" class="externalLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notification</a>). There
are even more ideas and some refactorings will happening
along with some modest changes in the module structure. So,

<p>The new <code>jolokia-jmx</code> module provides an own
MBeanServer which never gets exposed via JSR-160
remoting. By registering your MBeans at the Jolokia
MBeanServer you can make them exclusively available for
Jolokia without worrying about JSR-160 access e.g. via
<code>jconsole</code>. However, if you annotate your MBeans
with <code>@JsonMBean</code> and register it at the Jolokia
MBeanServer your get automatic translation of complex data
types to JSON even for JSR-160 connections:</p>
