Jolokia is a fresh way to access JMX MBeans remotely. It is
different from JSR-160 connectors in that it is an agent-based
approach which uses JSON over HTTP for its communication in a
REST-stylish way.

Multiple agents are provided for different environments:

* **WAR Agent** for deployment as web application in a Java EE Server. 
* **OSGi Agent** for deployment in an [OSGi][2] container. This agent
  is packaged as a bundle and comes in two flavors (minimal,
  all-in-one).
* **JVM JDK6 Agent** which can be used with any Oracle/Sun JVM,
  Version 6 or later and which is able to attach to a running Java process 
  dynamically. 


## Features

The agent approach as several advantages:

* **Firewall friendly**

  Since all communication is over HTTP, proxying through firewalls
  becomes mostly a none-issue (in contrast to RMI communication, which
  is the default mode for JSR-160)

* **Polyglot**

  No Java installation is required on the client
  side. E.g. [Jmx4Perl][3] provides a rich Perl client library and
  Perl based tools for accessing the agents.

* **Simple Setup**

  The Setup is done by a simple agent deployment. In contrast,
  exporting JMX via JSR-160 can be remarkable complicated (see these
  blog posts for setting up [Weblogic][4] and [JBoss][5] for native
  remote JMX exposure setup)

Additionally, the agents provide extra features not available with
JSR-160 connectors:

* **Bulk requests**

  In contrast to JSR-160 remoting, Jolokia can process many JMX
  requests with a single round trip. A single HTTP POST request puts
  those requests in its JSON payload which gets dispatched on the
  agent side. These bulk requests can increase performance drastically,
  especially for monitoring solutions. The Nagios plugin
  [check_jmx4perl][6] uses bulk requests for its multi-check feature.
  
* **Fine grained security**

  In addition to standard HTTP security (SSL, HTTP-Authentication)
  Jolokia supports a custom policy with fine grained restrictions
  based on multiple properties like the client's IP address or subnet,
  and the MBean names, attributes, and operations. The policy is
  defined in an XML format with support for allow/deny sections and
  wildcards.

* **Proxy mode**

  Jolokia can operate in an agentless mode where the only requirement
  on the target platform is the standard JSR-160 export of its
  MBeanServer. A proxy listens on the front side for Jolokia requests
  via JSON/HTTP and propagates these to the target server through
  remote JSR-160 JMX calls. Bulk requests get dispatched into
  multiple JSR-160 requests on the proxy transparently.

Contributions in form of pull requests are highly appreciated. All your work must be donated under the 
Apache Public License, too. Please sign-off your work before 
doing a pull request. The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the patch description, 
which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to
pass it on as an open-source patch.  The rules are very simple: if you
can certify the below (from
[developercertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/)):

Using your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your
commit automatically with `git commit -s`.

If you fix some documentation (typos, formatting, ...) you are not required to sign-off. 
It is possible to sign your commits in retrospective, [too](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13043357/git-sign-off-previous-commits) 
if you forgot it the first time.
